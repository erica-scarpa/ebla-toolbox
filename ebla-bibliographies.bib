Problems in operationalizing occupational comparability, relative income gains, and wartimes are discussed, and solutions are presented. Data comparing matched occupations between 1939 and 1967 are shown to provide support for Stinchcombe's proposition, and the paper concludes with a discussion of the generalizability of the findings.},

These assumptions are: (1) the critical deficiency under which most managers operate is the lack of relevant information, (2) the manager needs the information he wants, (3) if a manager has the information he needs his decision making will improve, (4) better communication between managers improves organizational performance, and (5) a manager does not have to understand how his information system works, only how to use it. To overcome these assumptions and the deficiencies which result from them, a management information system should be imbedded in a management control system. A procedure for designing such a system is proposed and an example is given of the type of control system which it produces.},

Since then it has been adapted to other formats, slowly becoming an international multi-media phenomenon over a span of several years. The title The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is often abbreviated as "HHG", "HHGG", "HHGTTG", or "H2G2". The series is also often referred to as "The Hitchhiker's Guide", "Hitchhiker's", or simply "[The] Guide." This title can refer to any of the various incarnations of the story, of which the books, having been translated into more than 30 languages by 2005. Although the various versions follow the same basic plot, they are in many places mutually contradictory, as Adams rewrote the story substantially for each new adaptation. In all versions, the series follows the adventures of Arthur Dent, a hapless Englishman who escapes the demolition of Earth by a bureaucratic alien race called the Vogons with his friend Ford Prefect, an alien from a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse and researcher for the eponymous guidebook. Zaphod Beeblebrox, Ford's semi-cousin and part-time Galactic President, unknowingly saves the pair from certain death. He brings them aboard his stolen spaceship, the Heart of Gold, whose crew rounds out the main cast of characters: Marvin the Paranoid Android, a severely depressed robot, and Trillian, formerly known as Tricia McMillan, a woman Arthur once met at a party who he soon realises is the only other survivor of Earth's destruction. After this, the characters embark on a quest to find the legendary planet of Magrathea and the Question to the Ultimate Answer.},

On the one hand, it is shown that Ragin’s notation and concepts are useful in bringing out some important features in Weber’s methodology and substantive writings. On the other hand, it is suggested that Weber’s use of configurations extend into areas that have received little attention in mainstream sociology.},

How can one explain the different appraisal of certain things in different temporal horizons and in different cultures? Cultural processes on how value is attached to things, and how value is re-established, are still little understood. The case studies in this volume, originating from anthropology and archaeology, provide innovative and differentiated answers to these questions. However, for all contributions there are some common basic assumptions. One of these concerns the understanding that it is rarely the value of the material itself that matters for high valuation, but rather the appreciation of the (assumed or constructed) origin of certain objects or their connection with certain social structures. A second of these shared insights addresses the ubiquity of phenomena of 'value in things'. There is no society without valued objects. As a rule, valuation is something negotiated or even disputed. Value arises through social action, whereby it is always necessary to ask anew which actors are interested in the value of certain objects (or in their appreciation). This also works the other way round: Who are those actors who question corresponding objective values and why?"--},

The stylised object is interpreted as a bull standing atop a peg, pointing to the adoption of hybrid Syro-Anatolian and Mesopotamian technological, iconographic and apotropaic values. It is suggested the object is ritual paraphernalia, likely in relation to the cult of the Storm God, used in a foundation ritual. Together with this peculiar metal product, the presence of other magico-ritual objects that point to northern Mesopotamian connections at the small hinterland site of Toprakhisar Höyük, on the outskirts of the Amuq valley, is considered to be a possible material reflection of new groups in the region, including Hurrians and Amorites, which contributed to the unity and regionality of the cults and rituals of Syro-Anatolian communities of the Middle Bronze Age.},

In the last few years, discoveries of new texts and archaeological materials from the Sealand Dynasty have emerged, which expand the possibilities to fill this gap in our knowledge of Mesopotamian history. At the same time, scholars have started to revive Kassite studies using new materials, methods, and questions. While those works are groundbreaking contributions to the field, many questions about the history and chronology, archaeology, economy, language of Babylonia during this period are still unsolved. This volume brings together eleven contributions by leading scholars in the Sealand and Kassite period, approaching those questions from an archaeological, ethnological, historical, linguistic, and economical point of view. The book opens with an introduction into the history and research on Babylonia under the Sealand Dynasty and the Kassites.},

At the same time it suffers fragmentation and loss of direction. Martin Albrow argues that these are not unconnected happenings. Here the author seeks to uncover the deeper meaning of Weber's work and thus recover a direction for sociology at the same time. He shows that Weber's struggle to establish a science of social reality both advances our understanding of the fate of the individual at the end of the twentieth-century and provides a profound sense of the reality of society.

Albrow's penetrating insight and sovereignty are those of a mature, even wise, scholar ... an important and profound book that should be used in all graduate-level theory courses'.

This cross-cultural phenomenon is documented here in reference to early Mesopotamian (Sumerian), Classic Mesoamerican (Teotihuacan), Mature Harappan, and Predynastic Egyptian civilizations. The commonality in the use of outposts in these otherwise very different civilizations is explained by three interconnected factors shared by many early states. First, the expanding economies of increasingly urbanized early state polities required regularized access to nonlocal resources. Second, for their own political ends elites in less-advanced surrounding communities would have been amenable to granting such access to early core societies. And, third, transportational constraints common to all premodern societies meant that the most efficient way to channel regular exchanges between distant geographic areas and differentially structured societies was by means of strategically positioned core outposts serving as collection points for peripheral resources and as distribution nodes for core-manufactured prestige goods.},

  abstract = {The emergence of early Mesopotamian (Sumerian) civilization must be understood within the framework of the unique ecology and geography of the alluvial lowlands of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers during the late 5th and 4th millennia b.c. The former gave Mesopotamian societies important advantages in agricultural productivity and subsistence resource resilience not possessed by contemporary polities on their periphery, while the latter gave them enduring transportational advantages. This material imbalance created opportunities and incentives that made it both possible and probable that early Mesopotamian elites would use trade as one of their earliest and most important tools to legitimize and expand their unequal access to resources and power. Given this, a still hypothetical (but testable) model is presented that accounts for the precocious socioeconomic differentiation and urban growth of southern Mesopotamia in the 4th millennium as social multiplier effects inadvertently set in motion by evolving trade patterns. This trade was first largely internal, between individual southern polities exploiting rich but localized ecological niches within the Mesopotamian alluvium during the Late Ubaid and Early Uruk periods. By the Middle and Late Uruk periods, however, inherently asymmetrical external trade between growing southern cities and societies at their periphery in control of coveted resources gained more prominence. In due course, importsubstitution processes further amplified the onesided socioevolutionary impact on southern societies of these shifting trade patterns. Unequal developmental rates resulting from the operation of these processes over time explain why the earliest complex societies of southwestern Asia appeared in southern Mesopotamia and not elsewhere.},

What should they consider when selecting one temporality over another? In this article, I examine scholarship that attempts to reconcile marking time with the analysis of change over time. Before beginning this analysis, I recount how the anno Domini era became the standard for marking time. I then discuss scholarship by Fernand Braudel and David Harvey in order to establish the general sociohistorical recognition that time is a multiplicity experienced differently by its subjects. In doing so, I tease out the irony of scholars accepting temporality as a multiplicity yet nonetheless using the anno Domini calendar system to mark time in their scholarship. I then take up work by Randall Collins, Dipesh Chakrabarty, and Hayden White, laying bare the ways in which they present a series of divergent possibilities for marking time in history that in turn call attention to its irreducible multiplicity. I read these scholars as invested in determining how to create and write with a language that is suitable for studying historical change over time but that does not rely on the assumption that time itself is something monolithic and prioritized above the Weltanschauungen of historical subjects. After presenting their models, I discuss the relative strengths and weaknesses of each approach. Finally, I close this article with a meditation on the dynamics of knowledge production in the historical guild vis-à-vis the possibilities and prospects of marking time differently in scholarship.},

In 2014, fifty years later, an international congress was organized to try and highlight the contribution of this excavation to the knowledge of the history, philology and art history of the Ancient Near East. This book collects the papers from this international congress. Bringing together established and junior scholars from various areas, Ebla and Beyond aims at fostering the dialogue between experts in different fields of the history and archaeology of Syria in the Bronze and Iron Ages and between experienced foreign scholars and the latest generation of scholars of the School of Oriental Archaeology of Rome. The contributions in the book on the one hand show how much the discoveries at Ebla during forty-seven years of fieldwork have changed the way of understanding the developmental trajectory of Syria from the third through the first millennium BC. On the other hand, the work of the scholars from Rome and elsewhere proves how, even in difficult times for field archaeology, it is possible to exploit the results of a long-standing enterprise of this kind in a fruitful and sometimes revolutionary way},

Our results show that the performance of social network analysis can be improved by using a small window size and calculating tie strengths with pointwise mutual information. This allows us to study the co-occurrences of gods in semantic contexts. From a network perspective, Aššur is not a very central god in our corpus despite his importance in Assyrian royal theology, but he rather joins the existing networks of gods without altering them.},

There are a growing number of annotated text corpora for ancient languages large enough to benefit from computational analysis. This chapter focuses on the cuneiform Akkadian texts available in the Open Richly Annotated Cuneiform Corpus (Oracc) and applies two language-technological methods, pointwise mutual information (PMI) and the fastText implementation of the continuous skip-gram model, to a dataset of 7,346 texts. To illustrate the potential of these methods, they are used to analyze the semantic domains of the verb râmu, “to love,” and its derivatives in Akkadian. Because the usage and semantic domains of a word can vary greatly between different genres, the dataset is divided into several genres, and the analysis focuses on royal inscriptions, letters, and literary text genres. The results show that, like the word love in English, râmu can denote different aspects of affection and love. It refers, for example, to erotic and sexual relationships between people, affection between family members, the king’s love of justice, and the gods’ pleasure with and acceptance of the king who fulfills divine expectations.},

La recherche sur le textile est devenue un secteur important de l’archéologie et présente un énorme potentiel, susceptible renseigner sur l’économie, la chronologie et différents aspects culturels des sociétés du passé. En raison des conditions taphonomiques, très peu de textiles ont survécu au Proche-Orient. Néanmoins, les quelques fragments préservés, combinés avec d’autres sources, suggèrent un savoir-faire développé quant à l’exploitation des fibres. Les analyses montrent en outre l’utilisation textile de plusieurs types de plantes et de fibres animales. Le lin et la laine passent pour être les plus importantes fibres textiles, du Néolithique aux temps modernes. Les analyses suggèrent en outre que les différentes étapes du travail des fibres étaient semblables dans toute l’Eurasie, bien que les différentes zones climatiques aient eu une incidence sur les besoins et les accès aux fibres. L’archéobotanique et l’archéozoologie informent également sur l’usage des textiles. Différents types d’installations (fosses, ateliers, etc.) et d’outils textiles (maillets, fusaïoles, métiers à tisser) ont existé et, bien que la plupart d’entre eux aient disparu du fait de leur matériau périssable, des fusaïoles et des pesons de métier sont bien attestés dans les contextes archéologiques. Cet article propose un cadre de base pour comprendre la production textile et apporte un éclairage sur l’obtention et le travail des fibres végétales et animales. On abordera plus brièvement la question du filage et du tissage. Pour cela, des informations issues de sources archéologiques et écrites seront combinées avec l’ethnographie et l’archéologie expérimentale.},

  abstract = {Textile research has become an important field of archaeology. Although the established analytical methods are often viewed as specialized, their integration with other interdisciplinary approaches allows us to deal with broader archaeological issues and provides the interpretational base for a much more comprehensive investigation of textiles in ancient times. Analyses of fibres, dyes, archaeobotanical and archaeozoological remains, as well as palaeoenvironmental and geochemical investigations, provide information about available resources, while tool studies, experimental testing, and visual grouping are approaches that explore the technology and techniques. Together, these approaches can provide new knowledge about textile production and consumption and, thereby, about people and society in ancient times., La recherche textile est devenue un domaine important de l'archéologie. Bien que les méthodes analytiques en vigueur soient souvent considérées comme spécialisées, leur combinaison à d'autres approches interdisciplinaires nous permet de traiter des questions archéologiques plus générales et apporte une base à interprétation pour étudier beaucoup plus en détail les textiles provenant des temps anciens. Des analyses de fibres, de teintures et de résidus archéobotaniques et archéozoologiques ainsi que des enquêtes paléoenvironnementales et géochimiques fournissent des informations sur les ressources disponibles, tandis que des études d'outils, des tests expérimentaux et le groupement visuel explorent technologie et techniques. La combinaison de ces deux approches peut apporter de nouvelles connaissances sur la production et la consommation de textiles, et de ce fait, sur les hommes et la société d'autrefois., ZusammenfassungTextilforschung ist zu einem bedeutenden Feld der Archäologie geworden. Obwohl die angewendeten analytischen Methoden oftmals als spezialisiert angesehen werden, erlaubt uns ihre Integration in andere interdisziplinäre Ansätze, weiterführende archäologische Fragestellungen zu behandeln und bietet die Deutungsbasis für eine wesentlich umfassendere Erforschung antiker Textilien. Analysen von Fasern, Farben, archäobotanischen und archäozoologischen Resten wie auch umweltgeschichtliche und geochemische Untersuchungen erbringen Informationen über zugängliche Ressourcen, während Werkzeugstudien, experimentelle Arbeiten und visuelle Gruppierungen Ansätze sind, die Technologien und Techniken erforschen. Gemeinsam können diese Methoden neue Erkenntnisse über die Textilproduktion und -nutzung – und dabei über die Menschen und die Gesellschaft in früheren Zeiten – liefern.},

The author suggests that the copy found at Ebla is not local, but imported (most likely from/through Mari). He briefly comments on the colophon, which bears in fact the name of scribe \emph{Ir}\textsubscript{3}-\emph{za-il} and a praise to god Zababa “king of Kiš”. He further proceeds on a comparison between the Abu Salabikh and Eblaite versions, observing several differences in content and palaeography (178-179; see also tables I-II). As a result of this analysis, the author concludes that the Ebla copy does not come directly from Abu Salabikh. He further comments on the content of the list, suggesting that it does not represent an actual personnel roster, but rather a scribal exercise. On pages 181-189 the full edition of the Ebla tablet is presented, followed by correspondences with the Abu Salabikh versions and indexes. Contains four pictures of the Ebla version.

He considers four Eblaite women who fullfilled this role during the age of the Archives: Tirīn-damu, Tinīb-dūrum, Tarib-damu, and Amaga. The author analytically collects and presents evidence concerning these women: all were royal daughters, although a few passages suggest a few DAM.DINGIR belonged to the viziers' family (such as~\emph{ti-a-bar-zu}\textsubscript{2}). In the closing remarks, Archi concludes that all priestesses were connected to the city of Luban and the cult of god ʾ\emph{a}\textsubscript{5}(NI)-\emph{da-bal}\textsubscript{(x)}.

He considers eleven case studies: six marriages (those of~\emph{i-ti-mu-ud},~\emph{ti-a-i-šar},~\emph{ri}\textsubscript{2}-\emph{i}\textsubscript{3}-\emph{du},~\emph{ar-za-du},~\emph{zu-ga}-LUM) and four funerals (those of~\emph{gi-mi}-NI-\emph{za-du},~\emph{da-ri-ib-da-mu},~\emph{ti-iš-te-da-mu},~\emph{du-si-gu}\textsubscript{2}). In addition, Archi also takes into cosideration~\emph{ti-ne-ib}\textsubscript{2}-\emph{du-rum}'s consecration as priestess (DAM.DINGIR). After a detailed analysis of the gifts delivered on these occasions, Archi concludes that upon their deaths women received the same set of garments and jewels delivered to them on the occasion of their weddings. He further proceeds describing the full set of garments and jewels generally delivered to high ranking women upon these occasions. He then investigates the gifts generally brought by the deceased to their ancestors, and concludes with a few remarks on the wailing rite. A detailed index of the jewels considered in this study is included.

  abstract = {During the twenty-fourth century BC, Aleppo, centre of cult of the weather god Hadda, was administered by an overseer under the control of Ebla, whose major god was Kura. Although Hadda had a temple in Mari, the region of the Middle Euphrates was dominated by the cult of Dagan, while ʾAdabal was the god of the Orontes valley. The king and his family played a regular role in the rites of Hadda at Aleppo. Twice a year, a renewal rite required the replacement of his mace and pair of bull's horns. Besides the mace, a chariot and two bulls with human faces were attributed to this god, an iconography which lasted into subsequent centuries. ‮في القرن الرابع والعشرين قبل الميلاد كانت حلب، مركز مذهب عبادة حدّة رب الطقس، تدار من قبل مشرف تحت سيطرة ٳبلة الذي كان معبودها الرئيسي هو اﻹله كورا . ورغم وجود معبد لحدّة في ماري غير أن منطقة الفرات الوسطى هيمن عليها مذهب داجان‬ Dagan ‮بينما كان عدابال‬ Adabal ‮هو إله وادي نهر العاصي‬ Orontes ‮.ولعب الملك و عائلته دوراﹰ منتظماﹰ في مراسيم حدّة في حلب حيث تطلبت مراسيم التجديد مرتين في السنة استبدال صولجانه وقرنين من قرون ثور . إلى جانب الصولجان، وعزيت عربة حربية وثورين لهما و جوه بشرية إلى هذا اﻹله، و هذه اﻻيكونغرافية استمرت فترة قرون تلت.‬},

An entire new province – northern Syria of the third millennium B.C. – is returned to the Ancient Near East studies, and, a unique case, on the basis of the complete documentation kept by a central administration.  This volume includes 1 yearly text and 24 monthly documents selected because they present sections concerning groups of men ordered according to crafts, women employed in menial works, and men passed in review in relation with military expeditions. A concluding essay is the first attempt to give a reconstruction of the palace organization of Ebla and the forces of the recruited army. One text lists the gifts to the members of the court (fixing their rank in this way) on the occasion of the marriage of the only daughter of the royal couple with a prince of Kiš, the major power of the time; in another one the funerary gifts to a princess are registered. Detailed indices complete the volume.},

The papers here look both inward towards resolving lingering questions from Sir Leonard Woolley's original excavations at the site, as well as new questions that have come up in the renewed excavations concerning life at Alalakh, and outward toward the city's place in a regional context. Covering chronological issues, textual evidence, scientific analyses, and a wide range of material culture (including especially ceramics, metals, stone, and glass), this volume encompasses the recent results of work at this important second millennium BC site.},

Other four wars opposed Ebla to Mari: the first three were won by Ebla, the last was fateful to it.

Of its early rulers, King List A contains the names of only the first six, and the Synchronistic List, the first thirteen, but the name of the eleventh king is destroyed, and the name of the ninth is damaged. The purported inscription of Agum (II) Kakrime seemed to point to him as the ninth Kassite ruler. However, Weidner's reading of it as mA-gu-u[m] (in 1926) proved to be wrong upon the collation of the much eroded tablet by Kraus (in 1949), so that Weidner had to retract it (in 1960). The entry has remained vacant. However, the traces of the original signs visible in the collated copy of the line can be restored as m⌈kak⌉-⌈ri⌉-[m-m]e, which is a variant spelling of ka-ak-ri-me, the epithet or agnomen of Agum II. This reading would fill a gap in the sequence of the early Kassite kings, confirm the chronological position of Agum II, and provide a possible new etymology of his second name.},

  note = {\\ \\ ☞ In this paper, Baldacci focuses on an elusive term (E\textsubscript{2}×PAP). The author first summarizes all suggested readings and translations up to the date of publication (1991). He then classifies all the contexts in which the term appears (alone, preceded by the preposition \emph{si-in}, and in more complex sentences). He then proceeds offering indexes referred to the persons involved and to the objects of the transactions. Baldacci then analyzes the lexical evidence, namely \emph{VE} 315 e\textsubscript{2}-pap // ʾ\emph{a}\textsubscript{3}-\emph{ra-tum}, \emph{ar}\textsubscript{3}-\emph{ra-tum}: he then concludes suggesting that the term presents a strong administrative relevance and that it may have a meaning such as “gift” or “allotment”. It is clear today that the term is connected to the funerary sphere and is variously translated as “cemetery”, “tomb”, or “funerary ceremony”. Any more precise connotation has not been yet suggested. For a recent account on the lexical evidence regarding this term, see Hajouz 2013, 274-275. See also Archi \emph{Qatna Studien, Supplementa} 1 (2012), 11.},

The aim is to understand when grain doughs started to be cooked in the Near East, how they were produced and what they looked like. Ingredients, ancient utensils, and baking techniques are investigated as well as ethnographic analogies suggested. The analysis is further enriched by a comparison with techniques and tools attested in historical periods and in ancient texts, including baking moulds and recipes. This contributes to the identification and understanding of the technological differences between varying bread-baking installations existing in the Ancient Near East that often are not differentiated in the literature, for which we instead suggest distinct contexts of use.},

Using a probabilistic latent-variable model, we leverage pairwise social differences between names in cuneiform tablets to infer a single underlying social order that best explains the data we observe. Evaluating our output with published judgments by domain experts suggests that our method may be used for building informed hypotheses that are driven by data, and that may offer promising avenues for directed research by Assyriologists.},

  abstract = {In May 1942 the Directorate-General of Antiquities decided to make soundings in the ancient site called ‘Aqar Qüf, whose ruined ziggurat is a familiar landmark in the plain about 20 miles to the west of Baghdad. There proved to be very little difficulty in tracing the four buttressed sides of the ziggurat itself, and on the south-east side the remains were found of a triple staircase of kiln-baked brick which had evidently led up to the summit, and corresponded closely to that of the Kassite ziggurat at Ur. Stamped bricks in the fabric of this staircase confirmed the identification of the site with the Kassite city called Dûr Kurigalzu.Early in the following year the Excavations Committee of the Department, headed by Mr. Seton Lloyd, F.S.A., Technical Adviser, decided on further large-scale excavations at ‘Aqar Qūf. One reason for the selection of the site was an economic one. Owing to war-time transport difficulties it was essential that any excavating work should be in the vicinity of Baghdad. Secondly the work provided an opportunity both for visitors to Baghdad and Iraqis themselves to see an archaeological excavation in progress. Many hundreds of Allied troops visited the site while the work was in progress, and parties of school-teachers and students were frequently escorted round the ruins. Finally, the archaeological importance of the site has long been evident. It represents a period in the history of Iraq concerning which there are few sources of information, and whose chronology is still controversial. Furthermore, it is a period during which the international relations of the various Middle East States are extremely interesting, as witnessed, for example, by the Amarnah Letters'.},

The first describes individuals as male or female and then distinguishes between adults, children and babies. The second disregards gender but offers six age groups instead, four of which refer to children. The article summarizes and interprets the information these early economic records provide on the gender and age groups of children. It shows how officials of institutional households in ancient Sumer defined the childhood of their dependents.},

As is usually the case, the academic sessions were accompanied by many opportunities for social interaction among the participants, and there was time to enjoy the historical and cultural benefits of Leiden. The book is divided into two sections. In the first section are three "Opening Lectures," by Hans Neumann on Mesopotamian society at the turn of the 3rd millennium B.C.; by Adelheid Otto on archaeological perspectives on private and state in the second millennium B.C.; and by Michael Jursa on the state and its subjects during Neo-Babylonian times. In the second section, 18 essays on various aspects of the relationship of private life and activity to the state and government in various periods are presented},

The author argues that dumu is essentially a kinship term “son/daughter, one's own child, offspring,” which lacks any age connotations. In contrast, di4-di4-la(2) designates children as an age grade. As in other languages, words for children as kinship and children as minors often exchange their semantic domains. Lu2 tur-ra, lit. “minor” is another age-grade term. In contrast, it has a pronounced social connotation and denotes those under patriarchal or professional authority, including children, youths, and young unmarried, or even recently married, individuals, as well as junior professionals.]},

The authors represent a highly international mix of leading academics whose expertise brings alive the people, places and times of the remote past. The emphasis lies firmly on the political and social histories of the states and communities under investigation. The individual chapters present the key textual and material sources underpinning the historical reconstruction, giving special attention to the most recent archaeological finds and how they have impacted our interpretation. The first volume covers the long period from the mid-tenth millennium to the late third millennium BC and presents the history of the Near East in ten chapters "From the Beginnings to Old Kingdom Egypt and the Dynasty of Akkad". Key topics include the domestication of animals and plants, the first permanent settlements, the subjugation and appropriation of the natural environment, the emergence of complex states and belief systems, the invention of the earliest writing systems and the wide-ranging trade networks that linked diverse population groups across deserts, mountains and oceans"--},

The analysis of the written data from the Adab city-state demonstrates that the royal house used the unfree as gifts to maintain a sociopolitical network on three spatial levels – the internal, local, and (inter)regional. The gift-givers and gift-receivers were mostly male adult members of the local and foreign elite, whereas the dislocated unfree humans were heterogeneous in terms of age, gender, and the ways they lost their freedom. The author relates the social profiles of both groups to the logistics of human traffic to reveal the link between social status and forms and nature of spatial mobility in the politically and socially unstable Early Dynastic Near East.},

  abstract = {The great relevance of Max Weber's ideal type of bureaucracy for understanding modern public administration is insufficiently acknowledged. Critical examination of the claims made to support "new conventional wisdoms" in the study of public administration reveals a remarkable similarity in the arguments made against Weber's ideal type of bureaucracy. The currently fashionable public-values approaches replicate neoliberal arguments that downplay bureaucracy to conquer a place in the field. Such dogmatism leads to neglect of the ways in which modern Herrschaft (domination) affects individual freedom. This article clarifies how the relationship between Herrschaft and individual freedom is central to Weber's ideal type of bureaucracy and how this perspective is still useful to understand modern phenomena such as privatization and deliberative democracy. It is concluded that the study of public administration would gain from the public-values approaches utilizing their potential to treat Weber on his own terms rather than replicating neoliberal mistakes.},

This article describes the process and conceptual work that went into designing the book's interface. It emphasizes that hypertext enabled through digital means is not intrinsically more dynamic than print since work in both forms requires equally intensive hermeneutical effort. However, the digital realm provides a more expansive spectrum of tools to formulate concepts and to build on them. Digital presentation can be integrated into processes of theorizing, describing, and advocating that form the core of scholarship in the humanities. The article focuses on three areas—narrative, evidence, and context—that are central to modern historical work. My book's interface demonstrates that web capabilities are compositional tools whose deployment should be mulled over in a manner similar to how authors treat writing and editing. Moreover, we should take account of the quotidian fact that, in our environment, information and knowledge reach us extensively via computer-based mediation. Whether in books or in articles, academic work is assimilated through piecemeal delivery rather than bound volumes. Instead of romanticizing traditional forms whose import may be diminishing, historians and other humanities scholars can create new arguments by being attentive to the web's capabilities and to the current social conditions of possibility pertaining to the circulation of knowledge. Facility with digital composition can then feed back into all forms of humanistic thinking and writing.},

In the process, significant meanings of the concept have vanished, while others have been added. First I explore the different meanings the concept of embeddedness has achieved in the new economic sociology. Then I argue that it is not the embeddedness of economic action that should constitute the vantage point of economic sociology, but rather three coordination problems that actors face in economic exchange: the valuation of goods, competition and the problem of cooperation deriving from the social risks of exchange. I show that by proceeding from these coordination problems economic sociology, economic anthropology and economic history can find common research questions which allow them to enter into dialogue with each other more systematically. In the next section I focus on the social-reformist inclinations of Polanyi’s use of the notion of embeddedness and thereby highlight a challenge posed in The Great Transformation that was largely not taken up by economic sociologists. Finally, I discuss limitations for developing a macro theory of the economy that result from making embeddedness the core concept of economic sociology.},

Their precise zoological classification, however, has never been conclusively determined. Morphometric analysis of equids uncovered in rich Early Bronze Age burials at Umm el-Marra, Syria, placed them beyond the ranges reported for other known equid species. We sequenced the genomes of one of these \textasciitilde 4500-year-old equids, together with an \textasciitilde 11,000-year-old Syrian wild ass (hemippe) from Göbekli Tepe and two of the last surviving hemippes. We conclude that kungas were F1 hybrids between female domestic donkeys and male hemippes, thus documenting the earliest evidence of hybrid animal breeding.},

This review describes key developments in prehistoric kinship, from matricentric hominin evolution to the Neolithic transition to agriculture and the heterogeneous resilience of matriliny. Starting with our hominin ancestors, kinship evolved among a cooperative breeding species to multilevel group structure among human hunter-gatherers, to substantial kinship changes brought on by the origins of intensified farming, to permanent settlements and unequal resource access. This review takes the approach that new forms of subsistence facilitated new equations of reproductive success, which changed cultural norms of kinship systems and heritable wealth. Subsequently, the formation of complex societies diminished kinship as the primary organizing principle of society. The article describes new methodologies and theoretical developments, along with critiques of bioarchaeological interpretations of prehistoric kinship.},

Examples of demographic change are examined, ranging from relatively straightforward instances of causation to more complex cases. Ten criteria are proposed that are intended to assist in the evaluation of causation in the context of demographic change.},

Afterwards, the king of Nagar and his retinue followed Yibbiʾ-ḏikir to Ebla: there they discuss the marriage agreement involving Tagriš-Damu and the son of Nagar's king.~75.1250~registers the wedding ceremony, as well as several gifts including the bride's. Biga shows the different moments characterizing royal intermarriages, from the discussion of the marriage agreement, to the celebrations, and departure of the bride to her new home.},

  note = {\\ \\ ☞ Here Biga examines the role of women at Ebla according to the administrative record. Starting from a general assessment of the social position of high ranking women (such as the queen,~\emph{MA-LIK-TUM}, the court ladies, dam en, and the viziers' female relatives) she then considers the positions of two of the most important among them: Dusigu and Tabūr-damu. Biga then briefly considers the role of women in rituals, namely in the royal marriage and in the AN.EN.KI/\textsuperscript{d}en\textsuperscript{ki}ritual. She then offers a state-of-the-art précis on royal intermarriages at Ebla, which mainly involved female members of the royal family. She then offers a few remarks on priestesses (DAM.DINGIR), focusing on passages suggesting that young boys and girls were offered as gifts to different deities. She then concludes with an overview on female workers: valets (dam/dumu-mi\textsubscript{2}~pa\textsubscript{4}:šeš), wet-nurses (ga-du\textsubscript{8}), midwives (ša\textsubscript{3}-zu/\emph{mu-wa-li-dum}), physicians ([dam] azu[-mi\textsubscript{2}]), entertainers (dancers/NE.DI, musical performers/nar), cooks (muḫaldim-mi\textsubscript{2}), and workers involved in the textile production.},

Biga had proposed an identification with Egypt, A. Archi then argued that Dugurasu was situated in northwestern Iran. This study offers a systematic examination of all the attestations of Dugurasu, focusing on the types of materials traded between Dugurasu and Ebla. It also considers evidence bearing on Ebla’s commercial partner named DUlu. Characteristically, Ebla and DUlu exchanged the same types of goods as those traded between Ebla and Dugurasu. Our investigation strongly suggests that Dugurasu is either Egypt itself or some place in Palestine that served as an intermediary in exchanges between Egypt and Ebla, while DUlu denotes either Byblos or one of its immediate neighbors.},

Happily, I found ample evidence of transcendence, with the exception of Modes of production and archaeology. Historians properly recognise Karl Marx as an important contributor to Western thought in a time of economic turmoil one and a half centuries ago. Especially, his efforts to motivate opposition to an exploitative economic system are highly regarded—I, for one, have made a pilgrimage to view his work-space in the British Museum reading room. And I agree that ideas influenced by Marx and Engels (considering the work of Childe, White, Wittfogel, Polanyi and the like) have been so thoroughly internalised that they amount to a kind of “disciplinary common sense” (in the introductory chapter by Robert Rosenswig and Jerimy Cunningham, p. 1), perhaps better characterised as ‘entrenched ideas’. From the perspective of contemporary anthropological theory, however, I find it difficult to understand why researchers might insist on bringing notions from Marx and Engels directly into today's archaeological thinking and practice, but this is exactly what most of the contributors to Modes of production and archaeology have done.},

The author makes effective use of simple, line drawings to illustrate the concepts introduced.Topics are presented with clarity and precision. The author's enthusiasm for his subject, and his desire to make it comprehensible to the widest possible audience are evident. It is a good foundation for exploring the more exotic aspects of physics, as presented by, for example, Close, Davies and Hawking. Suggestions for further reading are included as an appendix.},

  abstract = {Nel centenario del primo conflitto mondiale, i ricordi di guerra di un testimone d’eccezione. Con uno stile sobrio e attraverso un’approfondita analisi storiografica, Marc Bloch porta sotto gli occhi del lettore l’esperienza della guerra con i suoi orrori ma anche con i suoi momenti di inaspettata bellezza. «Le notizie false, in tutta la molteplicità delle loro forme – semplici dicerie, imposture, leggende ‐, hanno riempito la vita dell’umanità. Come nascono? da quali elementi traggono la loro consistenza? come si propagano, guadagnando in ampiezza a mano a mano che passano di bocca in bocca o di scritto in scritto? Nessun interrogativo più di questi merita d’appassionare chiunque ami riflettere sulla storia». Una lezione di scetticismo, sugli aspetti comunicativi della storia dei vinti, sui microepisodi che rispondono ad alcune domande della critica storica, attraverso leggende, percezioni inesatte, un vero e proprio esperimento di psicologia collettiva. Agosto 1914. All’indomani della dichiarazione di guerra della Germania alla Francia, Marc Bloch lascia Parigi per raggiungere il fronte. Ufficiale di fanteria, condivide con i suoi compagni la dura quotidianità della vita di trincea, il caos degli scontri a fuoco con il nemico, la paura della morte sempre in agguato, il dolore per le tante perdite. Di quegli anni terribili, da cui uscirà con la consapevolezza del proprio mestiere di storico, ci darà nei Ricordi di guerra 1914-1915 un resoconto appassionante e pervaso da una sobria umanità, scegliendo di raccontare solo ciò che ha visto e vissuto di persona e proprio per questo rendendo la sua una testimonianza generale. Questa esperienza individuale sarà in seguito ripensata da Bloch nelle Riflessioni. Lo storico studia la guerra come «un immenso esperimento di psicologia sociale» e, partendo dagli stati d’animo collettivi che consentono ai pregiudizi di trasformare una cattiva percezione in leggenda, analizza la formazione e la diffusione delle false notizie che hanno circolato nelle trincee. Imbocca così una strada di ricerca che impronterà tutta la sua opera, costituendo una corrente d’indagine che darà vita a una feconda scuola di pensiero e che è ancora oggi di grande attualità.},

In this paper we shall present three case studies highlighting the promise and problems of encoding unambiguous identities, titulature and other disambiguating information, and treating divine figures as person-data, respectively.

The imposts collected by the palace are known from the preceding Old Babylonian and the following Middle Babylonian periods, with somewhat differing meanings and methods of recording. The present article examines the Sealand I evidence within the second-millennium Babylonian administrative continuum, in particular the collection of the šibšu, the miksu, and the kiṣru.},

  abstract = {The Sealand kingdom arose from the rebellion against Babylonian hegemony in the latter half of the 18th century BCE., forcing it to share power over Sumer and Akkad. Although its kings maintained themselves throughout the turmoil leading to the demise of the Amorite dynasty at Babylon, it remains one of the most poorly documented Mesopotamian polities.  Until recently, it was known to us mainly through its inclusion into later king lists and chronicles, but the recent publication of well over 400 archival texts from a Sealand palace, soon followed by literary and divinatory tablets, finally makes it possible to study this polity from primary sources. This book proposes a history of the Sealand kingdom based on the new evidence and a reevaluation of previously known sources.  The aspects examined are: the economy — mainly the palatial administration and transformation of agricultural and animal resources; the panthea and the palace-sponsored cult, which show that Sealand I kings may have positioned their rule in a Larsean tradition; the political history, including a discussion of the geography and the relative chronology; the recording and transmission of knowledge on the Sealand I dynasty in Mesopotamian historiography.},

In the last few years, discoveries of new texts and archaeological materials from the Sealand Dynasty have emerged, which expand the possibilities to fill this gap in our knowledge of Mesopotamian history. At the same time, scholars have started to revive Kassite studies using new materials, methods, and questions. While those works are groundbreaking contributions to the field, many questions about the history and chronology, archaeology, economy, language of Babylonia during this period are still unsolved. This volume brings together eleven contributions by leading scholars in the Sealand and Kassite period, approaching those questions from an archaeological, ethnological, historical, linguistic, and economical point of view. The book opens with an introduction into the history and research on Babylonia under the Sealand Dynasty and the Kassites.},

This article explores aspects of this question by examining how, in the wake of political, intellectual and cultural developments which marked the late second and the beginning of the~first millennium BCE, various streams of historiographic practice converged towards the writing of a Babylonian national history, or rather, national histories. In order to do so, three roughly contemporary sources, written in different milieus, are discussed as instances of this phenomenon: the Chronicle of Ancient Kings A, the Chronicle Concerning the Early Years of Nebuchadnezzar II, and the Imgur-Enlil Inscription of Nabopolassar. The contents, form, sources used, and intentions of writing of each of them are evaluated, and a number of shared themes and approaches are identified and proposed as elements of seventh/sixth century national history writing in Babylonia.},

A study of managers reading management accounting reports challenges that image, and shows managers to be more potent and inventive creators of meaning than Macintosh and Scapens would suggest. As readers of management accounting reports, managers draw from a wide range of interpretive schemes, facilities and norms in making their interpretations. Management accounting systems may mediate this interpretive process, but they can do so in surprising and unexpected ways.},

It also reveals that accounting is a technique that must be transcended to be used effectively and that its inadequacies challenge humans as moral agents.}

En général, l’épouse royale passive et le bébé royal espéré se révèlent être les personnes centrales de ces rituels. Le lien unique des rituels royaux d’Ébla avec la fertilité est souligné. Une nouvelle interprétation structurelle des rites royaux de mariage suggère en effet que, dans l’ensemble, les rituels royaux d’Ébla visaient uniquement à faciliter et à rendre possible la grossesse de la reine, également par la dévotion royale particulière envers les déesses protégeant la fertilité, la grossesse et accouchement. En outre, de nouvelles propositions sont suggérées concernant des questions lexicales et topographiques spécifiques, notamment maš-tápù, gú-a-tum et « Saza ».},

For anthropologists, the genealogical diagram is a piece of graphic shorthand whose theoretical status is rarely considered. This article pursues the visual dimension of various sorts of European `family trees' as examples of precedents for the genealogical diagram. Rivers's transformation of pedigree into genealogy included tapping the diffuse currency of tree imagery as a taxonomic device in certain domains of European culture. Darwin had already harnessed the language of pedigree to express phylogeny, which was given graphic expression by Haeckel. Calvinist charting of Christ's earthly ancestry back to Adam expanded, in its turn, the earlier Trees of Jesse. The genealogical diagram charts kinship within ethnographic time, but owe its moral tone and visual clout to sacred, scientific and secular forerunners.},

Pierre Bourdieu, a distinguished French anthropologist, develops a theory of practice which is simultaneously a critique of the methods and postures of social science and a general account of how human action should be understood. With his central concept of the habitus, the principle which negotiates between objective structures and practices, Bourdieu is able to transcend the dichotomies which have shaped theoretical thinking about the social world. The author draws on his fieldwork in Kabylia (Algeria) to illustrate his theoretical propositions. With detailed study of matrimonial strategies and the role of rite and myth, he analyses the dialectical process of the 'incorporation of structures' and the objectification of habitus, whereby social formations tend to reproduce themselves. A rigorous consistent materialist approach lays the foundations for a theory of symbolic capital and, through analysis of the different modes of domination, a theory of symbolic power.},

They also discuss at length Bourdieu’s work on culture and aesthetics, including his work on Flaubert and Manet and his analyses of the formation of the literary and artistic fields. Reflecting on the differences between sociology and history, Bourdieu and Chartier observe that while history deals with the past, sociology is dealing with living subjects who are often confronted with discourses that speak about them, and therefore it disrupts, disconcerts and encounters resistance in ways that few other disciplines do.This unique dialogue between two great figures is a testimony to the richness of Bourdieu’s thought and its enduring relevance for the humanities and social sciences today.},

  abstract = {In this article we discuss some issues that arise when a highly structural approach is taken to the development of prosopographies, based on our experience of three such projects. Databases in prosopography have traditionally been used to help a researcher analyse a large set of database-like historical materials—the database (Bulst, N. 1989, Prosopography and the Computer: Problems and Possibilities. In Mawdsley, E., Morgan, N., Richmond, L. and Trainor, R. (eds), History and Computing III. Manchester: Manchester University Press, pp. 12–18), acts as an intermediate aim, not a final one. For our prosopographical projects, the final prosopography is a highly structured database—not a set of articles derived, perhaps in part, from it. We have found that a highly structured model works well for our prosopographies when we use the database not to model the relevant content of the source materials (which, because many of the texts are historical narrative sources, are of course not well served by relational structures), but to model some aspects of how the prosopographer thinks about their materials, and their task. The article describes how the presentation of a prosopography in this way benefits the end user as well, allowing access via many potential indices and searches. Finally, it begins an exploration of how a user of our databases might interpret what the database tells them.},

On propose ici de rouvrir le débat sur le « kaunakès » en abordant plusieurs points complémentaires : – L'historiographie critique de la question, largement dominée par la joute scientifique qui a opposé Léon Heuzey, conservateur au Musée du Louvre à Paris, à Emile Cherblanc, Conservateur au Musée d'Art Industriel et Régional de Tarare, et leurs divergences de lecture des Guêpes d'Aristophane qui contiendraient les clés de l'interprétation, en dépit de l'anachronisme engendré par la date très tardive de cet opus. Un manteau appelé « kaunakès » y est décrit. – Les sources, entendues comme les documents d'époque, dont on dispose réellement pour documenter le sujet dans le cadre chronologique de la période «sumérienne» (soit les périodes pré- et protodynastique de Mésopotamie, ca. 3700-2340 av. J.-C.) : archéologie, textes, iconographie, etc. – Les méthodes, notamment comparatives, qu'on peut espérer développer, en déplaçant le débat en direction de l'archéologie du textile. – Un bilan sur les matériaux et techniques attestés en Mésopotamie dans la première moitié du IIIe millénaire avant J.-C, afin de réactualiser le débat et de discuter les différentes hypothèses possibles pour rendre compte d'observations archéologiques et iconographiques recontextualisées. – Les éventuelles survivances ou adaptations de ce vêtement à basse époque. Since the discovery of the Sumerian civilization at Tello (Iraq) in 1877, specialists in Near Eastern archaeology used to call "kaunakes" a specific garment worn by most of the dignitaries, which looks like a kind of skirt covered by locks. However, kaunakes appears too as dress, veil or scarf, and even linked with furnitures. It remains unclear if this piece is an animal fleece or a true fabric, as no archaeological sample of this cloth was found. This paper will explore the following issues: – The historiography of the scientific disputation between Léon Heuzey, Curator of the Musée du Louvre in Paris, and Emile Cherblanc, Curator of the Musée d'Art Industriel et Régional of Tarare at the beginnings of the xxth century, which is at the origins of the debate, and their divergent readings of Aristophanes' satiric opus The Wasps, which is supposed to provide the key of the interpretation, despite its recent date regarding to the Sumerians. A specific cloak, referred to as "kaunakes", is described there. – The sources, i. e. historical, archaeological, and iconographical documents available for the pre and protodynastic periods (ca. 3700-2340 BEC) – The methods, especially comparative ones, which can be used within the frame of the recent developments of textile archaeology. – The results concerning textiles raw materials and techniques found in Mesopotamia in the first half of the 3rd millennium BCE in order to discuss the different hypotheses in an accurate perspective. – The possible survivals of this garment in the late periods of Mesopotamia history.},

  abstract = {Old Babylonian texts from the first half of the 2nd millennium BC dealing with trade often suggest that Mesopotamia is the land of wool. For scholars who travelled in this area from the middle of the 19th century, it is easy to understand why. The environment allows people to observe numerous herds of sheep grazing in the steppe or desert areas surrounding the Mesopotamian plain. Civilizations of the ancient Near East are supposed not to change over millennia. But this assumption is too short sighted to explain the whole evolution of the wool economy. However, with the introduction of interdisciplinary studies in archaeology and history, we know that herding practices or uses of wool in Antiquity are synonymous with cultural behaviors which need to be understood on scientific grounds in a dynamic perspective. The same situation can be observed in the Aegean, although the historical frame is shorter. Till now, despite the fact that textile research in Europe is an interdisciplinary and international discipline, it is paradoxically carried out mainly by scholars in isolation, in universities, museums, and laboratories. During the past decade, new analytic methods have been developed in the area of textile research and the archaeology of sheep husbandry, as exemplified by the 2010 European Science Foundation (ESF) Exploratory Workshop organized by M. Gleba and C. Solazzo, 'Archaeology of Sheep Domestication: New Approaches', which dealt with European historical periods. Therefore, it now appears essential to explore the origins and beginnings of the wool economy in the Mediterranean and the ancient Near East, where, remarkably enough, we lack any knowledge of the stages leading up to large-scale textile manufacture. The data provided by archaeology, archaeozoology, and philology needed to be brought together into a united historical perspective. There was in fact no prior systematic study of the multiple aspects of wool in the economies of the various Near Eastern and Aegean states from the beginnings of writing until the end of the 1st millennium BC. Scholars never before had the opportunity to compare their approaches and their conclusions. One of the main goals of the conference, whose proceedings are published in the present book, was thus to make colleagues aware of the enormous potential of such an interdisciplinary approach, which can revitalize historical research on technology, economy, and the environment in ancient Near Eastern studies.},

These stone memorials (traditionally called kudurrus) throw light on contemporary legal and economic practices with individual cases involving property rights, royal patronage, family disputes, overzealous functionaries, temple offices and income, and taxation woes. This article assesses a new book which discusses the form and function of these stelae. /// Du XIVe au VIIe s. av.

Ces mémoriaux en pierre (appelés traditionellement kudurrus) éclairent les systèmes juridiques et économiques contemporains en citant des cas particuliers: ceux-ci documentent le droit de la propriété foncière, la faveur royale, les fonctionnaires trop exigeants, les disputes familiales, les bénéfices et revenus du temple, et les problèmes fiscaux.

  abstract = {This review aims to expose the potential of formal network methods for archaeology by tracing the origins of the academic traditions, network models, and techniques that have been most influential to archaeologists. A brief discussion of graph theoretic applications in archaeology reveals how graph visualization and analysis was used since the 1960s in a very similar way to later network analysis applications, but did not seem to have influenced the more widespread adoption of network techniques over the past decade. These recent archaeological applications have been strongly influenced by two academic traditions, social network analysis and sociophysics. The most influential and promising techniques and models adopted from these traditions are critically discussed. This review reveals some general trends which are considered to be the result of two critical issues that will need to be addressed in future archaeological network analysis: (1) a general unawareness of the historicity and diversity of formal network methods both within and outside the archaeological discipline has resulted in a very limited methodological scope; (2) the adoption or development of network methods has very rarely been driven by specific archaeological research questions and is dominated by a few popular models and techniques, which has in some cases resulted in a routinized explanatory process. This review illustrates, however, the great potential of formal network methods for archaeology and argues that, if this potential is to be applied in a critical way, a broad multidisciplinary scope is necessary and specific archaeological research contexts should dominate applications.},

Unexpected results emerge when one sees archaeological reason emerge as an independent dimension of human reason and become a mode of thought. As such, it affects the way in which we view reality, so that the theoretical presuppositions loom even larger, and require a correspondingly fuller elaboration"--},

Burke explores the evolution of Amorite identity in the Near East from ca. 2500–1500 BC.~He sets the emergence of a collective identity for the Amorites, one of the most famous groups in Ancient Near Eastern history, against the backdrop of both Akkadian imperial intervention and declining environmental conditions during this period. Tracing the migration of Amorite refugees from agropastoral communities into nearby regions, he shows how mercenarism in both Mesopotamia and Egypt played a central role in the acquisition of economic and political power between 2100 and 1900 BC. Burke also examines how the establishment of Amorite kingdoms throughout the Near East relied on traditional means of legitimation, and how trade, warfare, and the exchange of personnel contributed to the establishment of an Amorite koiné.~Offering a fresh approach to identity at different levels of social hierarchy over time and space, this volume contributes to broader questions related to identity for other ancient societies.},

  abstract = {Unlike any time before in our lives, we have access to vast amounts of free information. With the right tools, we can start to make sense of all this data to see patterns and trends that would otherwise be invisible to us. By transforming numbers into graphical shapes, we allow readers to understand the stories those numbers hide. In this practical introduction to understanding and using information graphics, you’ll learn how to use data visualizations as tools to see beyond lists of numbers and variables and achieve new insights into the complex world around us. Regardless of the kind of data you’re working with–business, science, politics, sports, or even your own personal finances–this book will show you how to use statistical charts, maps, and explanation diagrams to spot the stories in the data and learn new things from it.   You’ll also get to peek into the creative process of some of the world’s most talented designers and visual journalists, including Condé Nast Traveler’s John Grimwade, National Geographic Magazine’s Fernando Baptista, The New York Times’ Steve Duenes, The Washington Post’s Hannah Fairfield, Hans Rosling of the Gapminder Foundation, Stanford’s Geoff McGhee, and European superstars Moritz Stefaner, Jan Willem Tulp, Stefanie Posavec, and Gregor Aisch. The book also includes a DVD-ROM containing over 90 minutes of video lessons that expand on core concepts explained within the book and includes even more inspirational information graphics from the world’s leading designers.  The first book to offer a broad, hands-on introduction to information graphics and visualization, The Functional Art reveals:  • Why data visualization should be thought of as “functional art” rather than fine art • How to use color, type, and other graphic tools to make your information graphics more effective, not just better looking  • The science of how our brains perceive and remember information ¿ • Best practices for creating interactive information graphics • A comprehensive look at the creative process behind successful information graphics ¿ • An extensive gallery of inspirational work from the world’s top designers and visual artists  On the DVD-ROM: In this introductory video course on information graphics, Alberto Cairo goes into greater detail with even more visual examples of how to create effective information graphics that function as practical tools for aiding perception. You’ll learn how to: incorporate basic design principles in your visualizations, create simple interfaces for interactive graphics, and choose the appropriate type of graphic forms for your data. Cairo also deconstructs successful information graphics from The New York Times and National Geographic magazine with sketches and images not shown in the book.All of Peachpit's eBooks contain the same content as the print edition. You will find a link in the last few pages of your eBook that directs you to the media files.  Helpful tips: If you are able to search the book, search for "Where are the lesson files?"

In this highly anticipated follow-up to The Functional Art—Alberto Cairo’s foundational guide to understanding information graphics and visualization—the respected data visualization professor explains in clear terms how to work with data, discover the stories hidden within, and share those stories with the world in the form of charts, maps, and infographics. In The Truthful Art, Cairo transforms elementary principles of data and scientific reasoning into tools that you can use in daily life to interpret data sets and extract stories from them.     The Truthful Art explains:   • The role infographics and data visualization play in our world • Basic principles of data and scientific reasoning that anyone can master • How to become a better critical thinker • Step-by-step processes that will help you evaluate any data visualization (including your own) • How to create and use effective charts, graphs, and data maps to explain data to any audience    The Truthful Art is also packed with inspirational and educational real-world examples of data visualizations from such leading publications as The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Estado de São Paulo (Brazil), Berliner Morgenpost (Germany), and many more.},

In the last few years, discoveries of new texts and archaeological materials from the Sealand Dynasty have emerged, which expand the possibilities to fill this gap in our knowledge of Mesopotamian history. At the same time, scholars have started to revive Kassite studies using new materials, methods, and questions. While those works are groundbreaking contributions to the field, many questions about the history and chronology, archaeology, economy, language of Babylonia during this period are still unsolved. This volume brings together eleven contributions by leading scholars in the Sealand and Kassite period, approaching those questions from an archaeological, ethnological, historical, linguistic, and economical point of view. The book opens with an introduction into the history and research on Babylonia under the Sealand Dynasty and the Kassites.},

Presenting a diverse range of case examples from around the globe, Cameron offers a critical and philosophical reflection on the ways in which digital cultural heritage is currently framed as societal data worth passing on to future generations in two distinct forms: digitally born and digitizations. Demonstrating that most perceptions of digital cultural heritage are distinctly western in nature, the book also examines the complicity of such heritage in climate change and environmental destruction and injustice. Going further still, the book theorizes the future of digital data, heritage, curation and the notion of the human in the context of the profusion of new types of societal data and production processes driven by the intensification of data economies and through the emergence of new technologies. In so doing, the book makes a case for the development of new types of heritage that comprise AI, automated systems, biological entities, infrastructures, minerals and chemicals - all of which have their own forms of agency, intelligence and cognition. The Future of Digital Data, Heritage and Curation is essential reading for academics and students engaged in the study of museums, archives, libraries, galleries, archaeology, cultural heritage management, information management, curatorial studies and digital humanities"--},

Using the chaîne opératoire approach, tools are identified, their roles in the production process explained and their significance explored. The results trace the production of textiles from spinning through loom weaving to fabric construction with needles. The use of a variety of fibre-based plants is suggested and tentative evidence for the early use of ground looms explored.},

This principle implies a comparative method and a critique of conventional economics. Besides, the problem of the interrelation between the economic system and other aspects of social life cannot be avoided. On this basis, Polanyi points out the peculiar "economic" nature of the market-capitalist society and explains the institutional transformations characterizing its history. The opposition "embedded/disembedded," used by Polanyi to distinguish pre-modern economies from the market economy, has been widely adopted in recent times, particularly by economic sociologists, as a key for understanding current complex economic phenomena. However, the reference to Polanyi often presupposes a distorted interpretation of his theory, and a different kind of institutional approach.},

The rate of change is very important for the further effects. If middle-aged and old people are less likely to change, we get differences between birth cohorts at any given time and, for the population as a whole, delayed response to new conditions. Studies of rigidity and age generally support a fixation model of cohort behavior, and so do data on mobility and age. A tentative model of cohort effects is developed on this basis and the corresponding lag function shown; it implies a pattern of smooth oscillations in the behavioral time series with an average "period" of 25 years or more. The result has nothing to do with the distance between generations as customarily understood, i.e., from birth to marriage and child-bearing.]},

They argue that accounting played a key technical role in enhancing rationality and furthering the development of capitalism methods of production. The history of accounting methods and practices from the Middle Ages to the 19th century is surveyed in order to evaluate these arguments. Two important dimensions of accounting are discussed: the rhetorical and the technical. The argument is that, as rethoric, accounting must be understood as an attempt to convince some audience of the legitimacy of business ventures. Goody's analysis of writing and literacy is applied to the development of accounting as a technique. As a practical method, double-entry bookkeeping appears to have increased "rationality," but the rhetorical side of double entry is also critical. The conclusion is that the significance of double-entry bookkeeping can be appreciated only if its rhetorical and technical aspects are considered.},

It is a tool for communication as well as cognition: conveying information to interlocutors, orchestrating interaction, and supporting problem-solving and learning. Over the past 25 years, the community of scholars interested in gesture has grown from a specialized group to a multidisciplinary community incorporating gesture into a wide range of topics. This article aims to capture and continue that growth by introducing readers to some of the most intriguing findings and questions in gesture research. It adopts a four-field approach, integrating multiple literatures and introducing work from outside anthropology. It defines key terminology and reviews five areas that have undergone significant recent growth: the integration of gesture with speech, gesture as communication and cognition, gesture's role in learning and language development, cultural variation in gesture, and the role of gesture in language origins. Taken together, these areas demonstrate that gesture is entangled with language, thought, and identity, starting in early childhood. This tangle has deep evolutionary roots; indeed, gesture may have been part of the human story from its start.},

C'est en tant qu'archéologue que je me propose ici de réexaminer en détail, dans la mesure du possible, le contexte archéologique des textes trouvés dans les maisons du Ier millénaire av. J.-C. La documentation cunéiforme de cette époque est particulièrement abondante puisqu'elle représente des milliers de tablettes, mais elle n'est pas toujours issue de fouilles régulières. Un certain nombre de textes, cependant, a été retrouvé in situ, notamment dans des habitations privées. Préciser leur contexte permet de nous éclairer sur les différentes façons de conserver les textes, mais aussi sur le statut de ces documents, qu'il s'agisse d'archives au sens strict ou de textes disparates, d'archives mortes mises au rebut ou abandonnées, ou d'archives vivantes qui se trouvaient sur place au moment de la destruction des maisons. Ce type de problématique concernant le Ier millénaire est d'autant plus justifié que l'on constate à cette époque une exceptionnelle longévité de certaines archives (jusqu'à trois siècles) et des demeures privées qui les abritent (plusieurs générations).},

Bringing together established and junior scholars from various areas, Ebla and Beyond aims at fostering the dialogue between experts in different fields of the history and archaeology of Syria in the Bronze and Iron Ages and between experienced foreign scholars and the latest generation of scholars of the School of Oriental Archaeology of Rome. The contributions in the book on the one hand show how much the discoveries at Ebla during forty-seven years of fieldwork have changed the way of understanding the developmental trajectory of Syria from the third through the first millennium BC. On the other hand, the work of the scholars from Rome and elsewhere proves how, even in difficult times for field archaeology, it is possible to exploit the results of a long-standing enterprise of this kind in a fruitful and sometimes revolutionary way},

The model of administrative reduction of variance in behavior developed by Inkson, Hickson and Pugh is used as the framework of analysis. The model postulates that two main strategies of administrative control, structuring of activities and centralization, will give rise to conforming behavior and low levels of conflict through their prescription of roles. Structuring of activities, however, is found to be associated with higher levels of conflict and hardly at all with conforming behavior, while centralization is associated with higher levels of conforming behavior, but not with conflict. In general the pattern of relationships between the variables located at different levels of organizational analysis is more complex than previously envisaged.},

  abstract = {Il progetto di ricerca ha preso in esame alcuni dei termini interpretati come nomi di funzione, documentati nei testi degli archivi del XXIV sec. a.C. di Ebla (Tell Mardikh, Siria), al fine di meglio definirne il ruolo. Tali termini sono: a-am, ib, ú-a, a-ur4, ugula, ur4, maškim e maškim:e-gi4. La ricerca è stata svolta attraverso un'analisi puntuale delle attestazioni nelle quali i termini indagati sono registrati, raccolte tramite l'utilizzo dei glossari e degli indici onomastici presenti nei volumi delle collane Archivi Reali di Ebla Testi (ARET) e Materiali Epigrafici di Ebla (MEE), con l'aggiunta anche dei passi citati in vari altri studi eblaiti, per un totale di circa 5000 attestazioni. La ricerca è stata integrata con un’ampia e articolata analisi prosopografica rivolta non solo ai nomi personali dei vari funzionari presi in esame, ma anche ai nomi di tutte le persone cui essi sono connessi. Tale analisi prosopografica è stata condotta utilizzando le risorse on-line Ebla Digital Archives (EbDA) dell'Università Ca' Foscari di Venezia (http://ebda.cnr.it/) e The Prosopography of Ebla dell'Università degli Studi di Firenze (https://www.sagas.unifi.it/vp-336-prosopographyebla.html). L'analisi delle attestazioni dei termini indagati ha consentito di determinare: se i termini selezionati e indagati siano da considerare come nomi di funzione o di professione; quali fossero le attività caratteristiche per ciascuna categoria di funzionari; il loro legame alle famiglie dei ministri o del re.    This PhD research project examined some selected terms among those interpreted as function names and mostly documented in the texts of the 24th century B.C. city archives of Ebla (Tell Mardikh, Syria). The examined terms are: a-am, ib, ú-a, a-ur4, ugula, ur4, maškim e maškim:e-gi4. In order to better define the role of the people qualified by these function names, this research was conducted by gathering the attestations that recorded the analysed terms. Those attestations were collected using the glossaries and the onomastic indices found in the volumes of the series Archivi Reali di Ebla Testi (ARET) and Materiali Epigrafici di Ebla (MEE). In addition to those attestations, recordings quoted in various other eblaitic studies were gathered, reaching an amount of approximately 5000 units. A wide prosopographic analysis of the personal names of the various examined officials, which also included the names of all the people connected to officials themselves, complete the PhD research. The prosopographic analysis was conducted using the on-line projects Ebla Digital Archives (EbDA), by the Università Ca' Foscari of Venice (http://ebda.cnr.it/) and The Prosopography of Ebla, by the Università degli Studi di Firenze (https://www.sagas.unifi.it/vp-336-prosopographyebla.html). The investigated terms analysis allowed to determine which of these terms can be considered as function names, rather than professional names; which activities were the most distinctive for each function term; these functionaries' closeness to the families of the Eblaite king and of the ministers.},

In the last few years, discoveries of new texts and archaeological materials from the Sealand Dynasty have emerged, which expand the possibilities to fill this gap in our knowledge of Mesopotamian history. At the same time, scholars have started to revive Kassite studies using new materials, methods, and questions. While those works are groundbreaking contributions to the field, many questions about the history and chronology, archaeology, economy, language of Babylonia during this period are still unsolved. This volume brings together eleven contributions by leading scholars in the Sealand and Kassite period, approaching those questions from an archaeological, ethnological, historical, linguistic, and economical point of view. The book opens with an introduction into the history and research on Babylonia under the Sealand Dynasty and the Kassites.},

Weber ([1922] 1978:85) defined formal rationality as the purposeful calculation of the most efficient means and procedures to realise goals. Formal rationality is the type of thinking and logical deduction that people use to determine what is most important in particular situations and the most effectual method they should use for reaching desired goals. Tradition, sentimentality, outmoded customs, piety and various other types of potentially less effective ways of doing things are discarded in favour of the most efficient action that can be calculated to achieve the ultimate outcome: what some call the ‘bottom line’.},

It also explores the repercussions of copyright law and fair use for scholars in a digital age and examines more cutting-edge web techniques involving interactivity, such as sites that use the medium to solicit and collect historical artifacts. Finally, the book provides basic guidance for ensuring that the digital history the reader creates will not disappear in a few years. Throughout, Digital History maintains a realistic sense of the advantages and disadvantages of putting historical documents, interpretations, and discussions online.The authors write in a tone that makes Digital History accessible to those with little knowledge of computers, while including a host of details that more technically savvy readers will find helpful. And although the book focuses particularly on historians, those working in related fields in the humanities and social sciences will also find this to be a useful introduction. Digital History builds upon more than a decade of experience and expertise in creating pioneering and award-winning work by the Center for History and New Media at George Mason University.},

The functionalism that resulted moved in one direction, while social research has progressively moved in an individual-behavioristic direction, resulting in an ever-widening divergence between research and theory. This paper describes paths in research and in theory development, that will reconstitute relevance of each for the other. The essential elements are two. The first is use of a theory of purposive action as a foundation for social theory; this entails acceptance of a form of methodological individualism and rejection of holism. The second is a focus in social research and theory on the movement from the level of individual actions to macrosocial functioning, that is, the level of system behavior.},

  abstract = {Published here for the first time is much of a final and long-anticipated work on philosophy of history by the great Oxford philosopher and historian R.G. Collingwood (1889-1943). The original text of this uncompleted work has only recently been discovered. It is accompanied by further, shorter writings by Collingwood on historical knowledge and inquiry, selected from previously unpublished manuscripts held at the Bodleian Library, Oxford. All these writings, besides containing entirely new ideas, discuss further many of the issues which Collingwood famously raised in The Idea of History and in his Autobiography. The volume includes also two conclusions written by Collingwood for lectures which were eventually revised and published as The Idea of Nature, but which have relevance also to his philosophy of history.; A lengthy editorial introduction sets these writings in their context, and discusses philosophical questions to which they give rise. The editors also consider why Collingwood left The Principles of History unfinished at his death, and what significance should be attached to the fact that it contains no reference to the idea of historical understanding as re-enactment. This volume will be a landmark publication not just in Collingwood studies but in philosophy of history generally.},

  abstract = {The term ‘social history’ refers to a subdiscipline of the historical sciences on the one hand and to a general approach to history that focuses on society at large on the other hand. In both manifestations, social history developed from marginal and tentative origins at the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries, and experienced a triumphant expansion from the 1950s to the 1980s. Social historians sought to uncover the relationships between economic, demographic, and social processes and structures, as well as their impact on social stratification, political institutions, social movements, ideologies, and forms of ‘public’ and ‘private’ behavior. For the comprehensive variant of ‘social history,’ the term ‘history of society’ has gained currency. Class, social status, standard of living, the family, work, social mobility, inequality, modernization, conflict, race, and gender are central keywords in this historiography. Interdisciplinary contact with sociology, especially historical sociology, economics, demography, political science, and, more recently, anthropology and cultural studies has been intensive. The borrowing of concepts and even the adaptation of ‘middle range theories’ (R.K. Merton) as tools in historical research and writing is a trademark of social historians as compared to traditional narrative historians. Comparative studies have embodied the interest in the application and testing of theories and have brought social history closest to historical sociology.},

  abstract = {For the past century, the anthropological study of the Mexican economy has accentuated the cultural and historical distinctiveness of its subjects, a majority of whom share Amerindian or mestizo identity. By selectively reviewing this record and critically examining specific foundational and later empirical studies in several of Mexico's key regions, as well as the U.S.-Mexico borderlands and the new trans-border space in the U.S. and Canada for Mexican-origin migrant labor, this book encourages readers to critically rethink their views of economic otherness in Mexico (and, by extension, elsewhere in Latin America and the Third World), and presents a new framework for understanding the Mexican/Mesoamerican economy in world-historical terms. Among other things, this involves reconciling the continuing attraction of concepts like 'penny capitalism' with the realities of a world ever more subjected to continental and global market projects of 'DOLLAR CAPITALISM.' It also involves concentrating on the production and consumption of commodity value.The key concept 'commodity culture(s)' serves as a thread to loosely integrate the separate chapters of this book. It is conceived as a way to operationally immobilize two contradictory tendencies: first, the tendency to understand an economy like Mexico's as a separate reality from its sociocultural matrix thus distorting its influence; and, second, the tendency to submerge 'economy' in its sociocultural matrix thereby diffusing its influence. This double immobilization promotes a focus on the interconnectedness of economy, society, and culture, but also makes it possible methodologically to approach themes like cultural survival, subsistence/livelihood security, use value, ecological degradation, human rights, or the sociocultural connectedness of the economy from the perspective of a commodity-focused analysis that privileges use- and exchange-value production and consumption. Such an approach provides a unique perspective in demonstrating how lived experience is informed by and shapes the diversifying funds of knowledge that enable Mexicans under economic stress to make culturally-informed choices in their material interest. The focus on deliberative decision-making, understood as involving utilitarian means-end reasoning necessarily influenced by social and moral considerations, promotes a balanced approach to the economy/culture relationship and to the role of agency in processes of economic transformation. The challenge to economic anthropology in seeking to understand processes of livelihood and accumulation in societies like Mexico with uneven development, persisting cultures of precapitalist origin, yet pervasive involvement in continental and global capitalist markets, is to deal with an unusually diverse array of capital/labor relations, as well as with significant sectors of the rural population with combined, if alternating, involvement in capitalist, petty commodity, and subsistence circuits of value production and consumption. The common denominator of this activity is deliberative choice by Mexicans regarding the acquisition, use, and/or accumulation of commodity value calculated in money terms. This market-responsive behavior, since the early 1980s, has been generated by conditions of subsistence and/or accumulation crisis in Mexico. There is an important message here that should be comforting to those in the United States who are threatened by or uneasy about the growing presence of Mexican migrants in our midst. It should also give pause to others who are quick to emphasize, even exoticize or romanticize, the cultural or ethnic differences between Mexicans and Americans. With regard to fundamental aspirations and considerations related to making and earning a living, including sociopolitical understandings, there is really very little difference between us. Too much has been made in the past of the concrete economic differences between our two countries represented in abstract, statistical terms (or in systemic terms regarding politics/political culture) as an asymmetrical First World-Third World divide. This notion of economic (and political) difference or 'otherness' has been reinforced by a conflictive and controversial history that has shaped the international border between the U.S. and Mexico, and reverberated in our respective national identities, since the middle of the 19th century. It has also been accentuated by the impersonal, instrumental discourse of international capitalist development which has made 'maquiladora, ' 'indocumentado, ' and 'cheap labor' household words in both countries. Against this litany of economic (and political) difference, the lesson to be gleaned from the record of study of Mexican/Mesoamerican commodity culture, from the highlands of Guatemala to the Valleys of Oaxaca or Guerrero to the coasts of Veracruz and along the Rio Bravo side of the border, is that its bearers and fashioners, the peoples of this vast region south of the Rio Grande/Rio Bravo, think and act about making and earning their livelihood just as we would in their space. It is this fundamental recognition of our common humanity that should be uppermost in all of our minds as we negotiate and struggle our respective ways together through NAFTAmerica in the twenty-first centur},

  abstract = {Much current work on organizational knowledge, intellectual capital, knowledge-creating organizations, knowledge work, and the like rests on a single, traditional understanding of the nature of knowledge. We call this understanding the "epistemology of possession," since it treats knowledge as something people possess. Yet, this epistemology cannot account for the knowing found in individual and group practice. Knowing as action calls for an "epistemology of practice." Moreover, the epistemology of possession tends to privilege explicit over tacit knowledge, and knowledge possessed by individuals over that possessed by groups. Current work on organizations is limited by this privileging and by the scant attention given to knowing in its own right. Organizations are better understood if explicit, tacit, individual and group knowledge are treated as four distinct and coequal forms of knowledge (each doing work the others cannot), and if knowledge and knowing are seen as mutually enabling (not competing). We hold that knowledge is a tool of knowing, that knowing is an aspect of our interaction with the social and physical world, and that the interplay of knowledge and knowing can generate new knowledge and new ways of knowing. We believe this generative dance between knowledge and knowing is a powerful source of organizational innovation. Harnessing this innovation calls for organizational and technological infrastructures that support the interplay of knowledge and knowing. Ultimately, these concepts make possible a more robust framing of such epistemologically-centered concerns as core competencies, the management of intellectual capital, etc. We explore these views through three brief case studies drawn from recent research.},

  abstract = {This paper studies the roles of accounting in decentralized and unregulated collective action networks. Although the recent past has witnessed a proliferation of social collectives, little is known about accounting in such loose and fluid forms of organizing. While the existence of putatively primitive accountings becomes discernible in some studies on collective action, literature has largely neglected to discuss these in more detail. Taking a conceptual diversion via the format of the list, this paper ascribes such rudimentary and short-lived accounting instantiations a more critical and integrated role in governing the network at large. We develop the notion of commensuration by form to account for the list's dual capacity to convert the world into boxes of equivalent size that can flexibly be reshuffled into new relationships and its ability to serve as an intruder to the world of accounting. The upshot of this perspective, a significant expansion of accounting's non-calculative structuring powers, is demonstrated by an in-depth study of a collective action network formed during the German refugee crisis in 2015. While repertoires of digital and analog lists formed the backbone of the network's infrastructure, we show how their creation, recombination, and growing dispersion constantly provoked arrays of dispersed micro accountings. Even if such accountings interfered with the lists for only a moment, we nevertheless observed their ability to leave more permanent traces by irrevocably residualizing, prioritizing or canceling out items in such lists. We argue that the interplay between listing and accounting is ever more relevant in times when collective organizing is reliant upon digital media technologies that have accelerated the production and circulation of the list as never before in history.},

Adam Crymble mines private and web archives, social media, and oral histories to show how technology and historians have come together. Using case studies, Crymble merges histories and philosophies of the field, separating issues relevant to historians from activities in the broader digital humanities movement. Key themes include the origin myths of digital historical research; a history of mass digitization of sources; how technology influenced changes in the curriculum; a portrait of the self-learning system that trains historians and the problems with that system; how blogs became a part of outreach and academic writing; and a roadmap for the continuing study of history in the digital era"--},

Positional characteristics presumed to effect occupational rewards were required talent (a job's functional complexity), disagreeability (e.g., physical labor), training, and perceived functional importance. In general, the data supported Davis and Moore's basic propositions. The theory was extended by considering some implied interactions and offering a tentative causal model for positional determinants. The model included a reciprocal relationship between income and prestige.},

It focuses in particular on the fundamental role of social interactions and information transmission as constituent elements for the development of organizational complexity on a community level. Given the impossibility of direct observations of these constituent interactions and practices, it is then outlined how this theoretical model can be applied on the material remains found in the archaeological record. It is discussed how material surroundings ? including architectural structures and material objects ? are used to shape and structure social interactions and practices in various ways. It is shown how complex organizational structures develop through underlying mechanisms of change such as diversification, connectivity and standardization, and how these can be applied in archaeological case studies. The presented framework will thus show how structures of social organization and development of social complexity can be inferred from the archaeological record.},

Social complexity in archaeology is commonly related to properties of complex societies such as states, as opposed to so-called "simple" societies such as tribes or chiefdoms. These conceptualisations of complexity are ultimately rooted in colonial and Eurocentric perspectives with problematic implications for the field of archaeology. This book provides an in-depth conceptualisation of social complexity as the core concept in archaeological and interdisciplinary studies of the past, integrating approaches from complex systems thinking, archaeological theory, social practice theory, and sustainability and resilience science. The book covers a long-term perspective of social change and stability, tracing the full cycle of complexity trajectories, from emergence and development to collapse, regeneration and transformation of communities and societies. It offers a broad vision on social complexity as a core concept for the present and future development of archaeology. The book is intended to be a valuable resource for students and scholars in the field of archaeology and related disciplines such as history, anthropology, sociology, as well as the natural sciences studying human-environment interactions in the past"--},

In the last few years, discoveries of new texts and archaeological materials from the Sealand Dynasty have emerged, which expand the possibilities to fill this gap in our knowledge of Mesopotamian history. At the same time, scholars have started to revive Kassite studies using new materials, methods, and questions. While those works are groundbreaking contributions to the field, many questions about the history and chronology, archaeology, economy, language of Babylonia during this period are still unsolved. This volume brings together eleven contributions by leading scholars in the Sealand and Kassite period, approaching those questions from an archaeological, ethnological, historical, linguistic, and economical point of view. The book opens with an introduction into the history and research on Babylonia under the Sealand Dynasty and the Kassites.},

Thus, Pareto is an important intellectual ancestor for economic sociology.},

This provided a unique chance to revise ceramic chronology and phasing of Early Bronze IVB at the site, and to elaborate a four-phase relative periodization (EB IVB1–4). Furthermore, a group of ceramic samples selected from different phases within this sequence recently underwent chemical and petrographic analyses within the Ebla Chora Project.In this article, we report on the preliminary results of the chrono-typological study, present a summary of the petrographic and technological examination, and put forward some considerations on pottery production at Ebla during the last quarter of the 3rd millennium BC. Building on these insights, we will try to frame Ebla's EB IVB typological and petrographic dataset into a micro- (the Ebla region) and macro-regional (Western Inland Syria) picture by means of parallels with other Syrian sites that have yielded EB IVB assemblages and/or petrographic data. This will allow us to deal with issues of inter-regional comparison and synchronization that might challenge current interpretations of EB IVB regional periodization and ceramic regionalism in Western Inland Syria.},

This book collects the papers from this international congress. Bringing together established and junior scholars from various areas, Ebla and Beyond aims at fostering the dialogue between experts in different fields of the history and archaeology of Syria in the Bronze and Iron Ages and between experienced foreign scholars and the latest generation of scholars of the School of Oriental Archaeology of Rome. The contributions in the book on the one hand show how much the discoveries at Ebla during forty-seven years of fieldwork have changed the way of understanding the developmental trajectory of Syria from the third through the first millennium BC. On the other hand, the work of the scholars from Rome and elsewhere proves how, even in difficult times for field archaeology, it is possible to exploit the results of a long-standing enterprise of this kind in a fruitful and sometimes revolutionary way},

Current explanations of connectivity across the Levant during Early Bronze IV, framed within the context of formation, crisis and regeneration of early urbanism, centre on the role of nascent states in Inland Western Syria – Ebla in particular – in structuring regional agro-pastoral strategies and triggering cultural transfer to the south. This article reviews the available chronological, archaeological and textual records in order to achieve a greater definition of the chronological resolution and geographic scale of possible patterns of interactions among the northern and southern Levant during the second half of the third millennium BC that have not been considered thus far. The article will discuss whether current explanations of connectivity between the northern and southern Levant during Early Bronze IV fit the data available and will explore possible alternative scenarios.},

Not only it was possible to gain a clearer picture of the site’s trajectory during Early Bronze IVB, the phase following the demise of Ebla’s Early Bronze IVA kingdom, but also to re-investigate how the site transitioned from the Early to the Middle Bronze Age at a deeper chronological scale, which was hampered before by the lack of sufficient stratified data. Moving from these insights, this paper offers a summary of the state of research on Ebla between the Early and the Middle Bronze Ages and proposes some ideas concerning this critical nexus in the site’s development. Moreover, unpublished stratified ceramic data are presented and examined that might allow current synchronisms between Ebla, the Middle Euphrates, and the Syrian Jazirah between the late 3rd and the early 2nd millennium BC to be re-considered, and to shed light on the site’s participation and role in region-wide processes that were taking place between the 3rd and the 2nd millennium BC. This way, this crucial connection in the developmental trajectory of Ebla and in the study of ancient Syria will be re-analysed offering insights into archaeology, chronology, and history.},

  abstract = {An Introduction to the Ancient World offers a thorough survey of the history of the ancient Near East, Greece and Rome. Covering the social, political, economic and cultural processes that have influenced later western and Near Eastern civilisations, this volume considers subjects such as the administrative structures, economies and religions of the ancient Near East, Athenian democracy, the development of classical Greek literature, the interaction of cultures in the Hellenistic world, the political and administrative system of the Roman Republic and empire, and the coming of Christianity, all within the broad outline of political history. This third edition is thoroughly updated and some chapters are completely rewritten to cover recent historical research. Changes include: more attention to economic structures and developments, and to the history of the later Roman Empire (third to sixth centuries AD); incorporation of the results of recent archaeological and historical research, and recently published studies of ancient literature; 'boxes' that support the main text, on topics including economic and political systems, religion and terminology; redrawn maps and new, higher-quality images; the inclusion of useful websites in the bibliography. An Introduction to the Ancient World provides an easily readable, user-friendly, integrated overview for students of ancient history, classics and archaeology. Lavishly illustrated, clearly and concisely written, and well organised, this fully updated and revised edition will remain a key resource for students beginning to investigate the civilisations of the ancient Mediterranean.},

  abstract = {In the last few years in France and the Anglophone countries, the subject of kinship has been eliciting new interest and new analyses. Four recently published works (three in French, one in English) offer an opportunity to assess how research questions and approaches, knowledge and theoretical debate are evolving in this field, a field that both anthropology and sociology are implicated in. Detailed study of the four works brings to light contrasting positions organized around a set of questions involving relations between the biological and the social, questions raised more than 20 years ago by David M. Schneider, an atypical North American anthropologist unjustly neglected in France. Today Schneider\&\#8217;s work seems to have marked a decisive turning point in the recent history of kinship studies.},

By confronting Weber's theory with recent empirical work, this article attempts to evaluate its present scientific status. Weber's failure to forecast correctly the current decline of bureaucracy in American society is only one of the shortcomings of his theory. But it achieves much, raises many researchable problems, and deserves reclaiming and refining.},

  abstract = {The creation of the Library of Alexandria is widely regarded as one of the great achievements in the history of humankind - a giant endeavour to amass all known literature and scholarly texts in one central location, so as to preserve it and make it available for the public. In turn, this event has been viewed as a historical turning point that separates the ancient world from classical antiquity. Standard works on the library continue to present the idea behind the institution as novel and, at least implicitly, as a product of Greek thought. Yet, although the scale of the collection in Alexandria seems to have been unprecedented, the notion of creating central repositories of knowledge, while perhaps new to Greek tradition, was age-old in the Near East where the building was erected. Here the existence of libraries can be traced back another two millennia, from the twenty-seventh century BCE to the third century CE, and so the creation of the Library in Alexandria was not so much the beginning of an intellectual adventure as the impressive culmination of a very long tradition. This volume presents the first comprehensive study of these ancient libraries across the 'Cradle of Civilization' and traces their institutional and scholarly roots back to the early cities and states and the advent of writing itself. Leading specialists in the intellectual history of each individual period and region covered in the volume present and discuss the enormous textual and archaeological material available on the early collections, offering a uniquely readable account intended for a broad audience of the libraries in Egypt and Western Asia as centres of knowledge prior to the famous Library of Alexandria. --},

  abstract = {The paper provides an overview of the digital tools developed as part of the Ebla Digital Archives Project, which aims to offer a digital edition of roughly 3,000 cuneiform tablets from ancient Ebla (modern Tell Mardikh, in western Syria), dated to the middle of the third millen- nium BCE. The Ebla archive is the oldest one in the history of mankind, for which extensive information concerning the primary setting of the documents is available. The archaicity of the writing system, combined with the inherent dif culties in reconstructing languages from the remote past (Sumerian, Akkadian, Eblaite), pushes us to rethink the strategies to properly digitally capture the complexity of these sources, of invaluable historical signi cance: admin- istrative documents, literary texts, vocabularies, letters, etc. We tackled the problem through the development of a PostgreSQL database, which is populated by ad hoc Python scripts that parse input transliteration  les, which in turn are encoded using a shallow mark-up language. The individual steps in such work ow are discussed, as well as the bene ts in terms of advanced queries for information retrieval that such approach offers.},

Once a set of organizations emerges as a field, a paradox arises: rational actors make their organizations increasingly similar as they try to change them. We describe three isomorphic processes--coercive, mimetic, and normative--leading to this outcome. We then specify hypotheses about the impact of resource centralization and dependency, goal ambiguity and technical uncertainty, and professionalization and structuration on isomorphic change. Finally, we suggest implications for theories of organizations and social change.]},

The study deals with three language groups: (1) Akkadian, (2) Northwest Semitic (i.e., Amorite, Hebrew, Ugaritic, Aramaic, and Phoenician), and (3) Arabic (classical and modern sources). The main findings of this study can be summarized as follows: (1) The occurrence of animal names in every corpus points to a common Semitic background imbued with metaphoric, affective, and apotropaic aspects. There is, however, no evidence for totemism. (2) Whereas names of herbivorous animals (wild and domestic) are found in every language examined, names of venomous animals, predators, and raptors are much more attested in West Semitic, especially Arabic, than in Akkadian, and this is apparently related to the symbolic nature of names within the social ideology of a society. (3) The survival of animal names in modern Arabic practices, specifically among nomads, points to an adherence to ‘pre-Islamic’ naming methods vis-à-vis normative Islamic views. These findings contribute to the discussion about naming in general and in the context of Semitic linguistic in particular.},

  abstract = {If the directed focus on “scholarly personae” recommended in How to Be a Historian: Scholarly Personae in Historical Studies, 1800–2000 is to be genuinely useful, we would need to attend far more systematically to historiographical differences, debates, and styles as rooted not only in the counterpoint between individuals and institutions but also in the larger contexts that govern how we identify what historical issues matter and the larger purposes and conditions of historical scholarship. We would need to identify more clearly not just how historical work is conducted but the ways prevailing debates over historical meaning and method have come to have specific names attached to them. The current crisis in the academic humanities puts all this in sharp relief, since the interest in scholarly personae also invites discussion about institutional conditions of historical work, from the existence of regular opportunities for careers and employment in the academic historical world to the vastly uneven distribution of institutional resources. What I argue for here is a kind of reflexive institutional historicism—the imperative, in other terms, to conduct historical work with a simultaneous concern for the present meanings and implications of the work itself and for the complexity of the interpretive questions raised by one's historical engagement with sources, questions, traditions, theories, and institutional conditions. Indeed, we need not focus on the theoretical aspects of history in order to appreciate the extent to which theory inflects, and is inflected by, the choices we make (and that are made for us) about everything from how to be a historian and who can be a historian to what kinds of historians we might be and, ultimately, what kind of history we write.},

Recent archaeozoological studies of the equids from the Umm el-Marra necropolis have clarified the hybrid nature of the buried animals; these may be specimens of the most valuable species, the kunga, recurrent in the documents from the Royal Archive of Classic Early Syrian Ebla. This article considers further data from Ebla texts on the rich equipment of chariots and equids for the royal court and its notables, men and women, and for allied kingdoms, and presents archaeological and figurative evidence from various sites, especially Nagar and Urkesh, for the high economic and symbolic value of kunga, identified on royal seals. These equids were a status symbol for their owners, even after death, as shown by the necropolis of Marra-Tuba and the burials of chariots among the funerary equipment of the Eblaite elites recorded in the texts. Finally, kunga may have circulated in Early Dynastic Mesopotamia and may be present among the animal remains of the Y necropolis at Kish and in the equid lying on the rein-ring from a tomb in the Royal Cemetery at Ur.},

The book opens with a theoretical contribution to notions such as cooperation, collective action, and social networks, followed by an essay providing a view of Teotihuacan urbanism based on a new understanding of its corpus of mural paintings. As for the near eastern side, the outreach of the Late Uruk culture outside southern Mesopotamia is evaluated vis-a-vis the emergence of Late Chalcolithic elites tackled through an analysis of large-scale resources distribution networks. The implications of surface surveys for studying early Syro-Mesopotamian urbanism are discussed in the framework of two newly designed field projects, while the specific subject of water management is reviewed through a study case in Central Asia. Finally, Adams' contributions between 2000 and 2012 are set into perspective and the volume closes with a complete bibliography of Robert McCormick Adams, highlighting his amazing contribution to many research areas and especially to the study of ancient urbanized landscapes.},

The essays and discussion topics were posted on a WordPress platform with a special plug-in that allowed readers to add paragraph-level comments in the margins, transforming the work into socially networked texts. This first installment drew an enthusiastic audience, over 50 comments on the texts, and over 1,000 unique visitors to the site from across the globe, with many who stayed on the site for a significant period of time to read the work. To facilitate this new volume, Jack Dougherty and Kristen Nawrotzki designed a born-digital, open-access platform to capture reader comments on drafts and shape the book as it developed. Following a period of open peer review and discussion, the finished product now presents 20 essays from a wide array of notable scholars, each examining (and then breaking apart and reexamining) how digital and emergent technologies have changed the ways that historians think, teach, author, and publish"--},

  abstract = {One hundred years have passed since Max Weber's death. This article explores an aspect of his work that, although fundamental, has received little attention in theoretical discussions about historiography: the relationship between explanation and narration. This article's analysis proceeds from two basic hypotheses: (1) some of the questions posed by narrativism to theory of history were already present in Weber's intellectual context; (2) in Weber's work, we can find a helpful, albeit nearly forgotten, answer to these questions insofar as his proposal situates the narrative explanation of history in the logical framework of causal imputation. Based on these hypotheses, this article's central objective is to examine how and to what extent a return to Weber can shed new light on the problem of historical explanation without disregarding its narrative nature. The article's first step, then, is to briefly review the fundamental questions posed by narrativism to the theory of history, with an emphasis on the structure of a historical narration; after that, it shows how and to what extent we can find a response to these questions in Weber's work. Ultimately, the article seeks to demonstrate the compatibility between the structure of a narrative, as evidenced by Arthur C. Danto, and the logical-causal explanation model proposed by Weber, which will serve as the basis for a clearer distinction between historical narratives and fictional ones.},

Rostovtzeff graded the key sectors of the ancient economy according to their importance as agriculture, forestry, mining, and fishing. Yet, neither trade nor textiles, however, were given any prominent role, although the latter are named as important products - but only for certain regions, these being Egypt, Phoenicia, Cyprus and the Greek poleis on the Ionian coast."

"Very briefly outlined, Finley argues, that the ancient (meaning more or less Greek) economy can by no means be conceived in modern terms. He believed the ancient economy to have been primitive, based largely on agrarian production, characterised by localised small-scale manufacturing and very little technical innovations."

"Although his highly influential study was only published 1973, when he was in Cambridge, a number of his ideas seem to have been developed much earlier under the influence of Polanyi and Jones.22 It is important to note, however, that Finley's position in particular, in spite of its undeniable impact, was questioned from the start, leading to divergent views on the ancient economy."

"The perception of entirely different types of economies is rooted in the idea of qualifying pre-modern economies as "embedded",59 which means that political and sociological structures are prerequisites for any economy, and that homo oeconomicus takes second place to homo politicus. This distinction is based on the assumption of a sharp contrast between the ancient Greco-Roman economies being characterized by the oikos and private property, and the ancient Near Eastern economies by large institutional units (i.e. palaces and temples) rather than by private property."

"A general view is that trade is a means to obtain sufficient basic resources for survival.88 Thus, our interpretations of the textile trade tend to be defined by general assumptions about the baseline of ancient economies. An example is the general understanding that the alluvial plain of Mesopotamia lacked sufficient resources, and thus, societies were reliant on trade and imports from areas richer in resources. Such assumptions are based on the principal idea that a lack of fibres would generate their import, and an abundance of fibres would facilitate their export."

Written by an expert with twenty years of experience in this field, the book is focused on the principles and fundamental concepts for application, rather than on specific tools or platforms. Each chapter contains examples of projects, tools, or platforms that demonstrate these principles in action. The book is structured to complement courses on digital humanities and provides a series of modules, each of which is organized around a set of concerns and topics, thought experiments and questions, as well as specific discussion of the ways in which tools and platforms work. The book covers a wide range of topics and clearly details how to integrate the acquisition of expertise in data, metadata, classification, interface, visualization, network analysis, topic modelling, data mining, mapping, and web presentation with issues in intellectual property, sustainability, privacy, and the ethical use of information. Written in an accessible and engaging manner, The Digital Humanities Coursebook will be a useful guide for anyone teaching or studying a course in the areas of digital humanities, library and information science, English, or computer science. The book will provide a framework for direct engagement with digital humanities and, as such, should be of interest to others working across the humanities too"--},

We propose a theory that social systems consist of actors and groups in constant motion. Further, we propose that the duality of actor and society generate a system that can be understood by using the concepts of complementarity, indeterminacy and the principle of relativity. Such a system is defined and the issue of social change is addressed. Basically, change is defined as an alteration in the motion of actors relative to the motion of groups. As the number of groups increases relative to the number of actors, the velocity of actors increases and the velocity of groups decreases. The increasing disparity of these velocities indicates greater social change.},

The Origins of the Choson Dynasty refutes that view, showing that a key feature of the dynastic transition was continuity in the structure and composition of the central ruling class and arguing that the main force behind the establishment of the Choson was the need to revamp institutions to protect aristocratic interests. The change of dynasties thus was less a revolution than a culmination of a centuries-old effort to create a centralized bureaucratic polity. Drawing on a wealth of data compiled from primary sources and presented here in 26 tables and 10 genealogical charts, The Origins of the Choson Dynasty provides an exhaustive analysis of the structure and composition of the central officialdom of the Koryo-Choson transition and offers a new interpretation of the history of traditional Korea.

Bringing together established and junior scholars from various areas, Ebla and Beyond aims at fostering the dialogue between experts in different fields of the history and archaeology of Syria in the Bronze and Iron Ages and between experienced foreign scholars and the latest generation of scholars of the School of Oriental Archaeology of Rome. The contributions in the book on the one hand show how much the discoveries at Ebla during forty-seven years of fieldwork have changed the way of understanding the developmental trajectory of Syria from the third through the first millennium BC. On the other hand, the work of the scholars from Rome and elsewhere proves how, even in difficult times for field archaeology, it is possible to exploit the results of a long-standing enterprise of this kind in a fruitful and sometimes revolutionary way},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT. At first glance, the compatibility of social theory and resilience thinking is not entirely evident, in part because the ontology of the former is rooted in social interactions among human beings rather than ecological process. Despite this difference, resilience thinking engages with particular aspects of social organization that have generated intense debates within social science, namely the role of humans as integral elements of social-ecological systems and the processes through which given social structures (including material relations) are either maintained or transformed. Among social theoretical approaches, Actor-Network Theory (ANT) is noted for its distinctive approach to these aspects. ANT proposes that human and nonhuman components (both referred to as actants) have the same capacity to influence the development of social-ecological systems (represented as actor-networks) by enacting relations and enrolling other actors. We explore the notion of agency that is employed in resilience thinking and ANT in order to extend our understandings of human-environment relationships through complementary insights from each approach. The discussion is illustrated by reference to ongoing assessment of resilience as it is experienced and expressed in two distinctive agricultural production systems: Indonesian rice and New Zealand kiwifruit. We conclude by establishing the potential for ANT to provide more profound theoretical conceptualizations of agency, both human and nonhuman, in analyses of social ecological systems.},

  abstract = {This dissertation investigates the emergence of Ebla as a regional state in northwest Syria during the Early Bronze Age and provides a characterization of Ebla that emphasizes its hegemonic rather than imperial features. The texts recovered from the Royal Palace G archives reveal that Ebla expanded from a small Ciseuphratean kingdom into a major regional power in Upper Mesopotamia over the course of just four or five decades. To consolidate and maintain its rapidly growing periphery, Ebla engaged in intensive diplomatic relations with an array of client states, semi-autonomous polities, and independent kingdoms. Often, political goals were achieved through mutual gift-exchange and interdynastic marriage, but military activity became increasingly common towards the end of the period covered by the texts. However, apart from installing palace officials at some cities, Ebla did not appear to have invested heavily in building infrastructure, such as roads or forts, along its periphery, preferring instead to leave matters of defense up to client and allied states. As a result, the archaeological impact of Ebla’s political hegemony along parts of its periphery was minimal.  In re-evaluating the archaeological evidence for Ebla’s growth in the mid-third millennium BCE, this dissertation shows that in only a few instances—for example, in changes to regional settlement patterns in the Amuq Plain, subsistence strategies at Tell es-Sweyhat, and the distribution of ceramic assemblages—can an Eblaite influence on material culture along its periphery be inferred, and even then, only indirectly. While Ebla’s sphere of interaction extended over a considerable territory, this dissertation restricts most of its discussion to Ebla’s northwestern frontier, and particularly to the archaeology of the Amuq Plain. This study demonstrates that even though Ebla had installed an official at Alalaḫu—the major polity in the Amuq Plain—local historical trajectories remained largely intact, and Ebla’s hegemony left only an ephemeral archaeological legacy in the area.},

Its popularity is clearly influenced by the introduction of Google’s Knowledge Graph in 2012, and since then the term has been widely used without a definition. A large variety of interpretations has hampered the evolution of a common understanding of knowledge graphs. Numerous research papers refer to Google’s Knowledge Graph, although no official documentation about the used methods exists. The prerequisite for widespread academic and commercial adoption of a concept or technology is a common understanding, based ideally on a definition that is free from ambiguity. We tackle this issue by discussing and defining the term knowledge graph, considering its history and diversity in interpretations and use. Our goal is to propose a definition of knowledge graphs that serves as basis for discussions on this topic and contributes to a common vision.},

  abstract = {The contributions in this volume -- resulting from an international conference held in 2016 at the Center for Advanced Studies of Ludwig- Maximilians-University Munich and supported by the LMU Graduate School for Ancient Studies 'Distant Worlds' -- aim to integrate material remains, textual sources, and the visual record regarding ancient Near Eastern temple inventories of the third and second millennia BCE. The conference encouraged researchers with archaeological and philological backgrounds to engage in holistic approaches to the constitution of sacred space and to the societal function as well as ideological and economic impacts of sacred gifting. Its focus on objects and practices led to a fruitful exchange with increased emphasis on entire assemblages instead of exclusive treatments of distinct object categories or text genres. Several contributions in this volume build on archaeological and textual evidence that was excavated in the early twentieth century but remains in continuous need for contextual and synthetic analyses. Others discuss more recent excavations undertaken with closer attention to contextual and stratigraphic details and exploiting new opportunities for scientific analyses. The temples under consideration range geographically from modern-day Iraq (Ur, Nippur, Khafajeh, Iscali, Assur) and Syria (Mari, Tell Bazi, Aleppo) to Turkey (Bogazköy), and chronologically from the Early to the Late Bronze Age (c. 2800-1200 BCE). Discussions start off from diverse sources such as administrative texts, votive inscriptions, small-scale finds, architectural installations, or three- and two-dimensional figurative artefacts but all contribute to an overall goal: To better understand the entwinement of the things, images, and practices that changed a physical space into a locus of encounter between humans and the divine},

  abstract = {Art and international relations during the Late Bronze Age formed a symbiosis as expanded travel and written communications fostered unprecedented cultural exchange across the Mediterranean. Diplomacy in these new political and imperial relationships was often maintained through the exchange of lavish art objects and luxury goods. The items bestowed during this time shared a repertoire of imagery that modern scholars call the first International Style in the history of art.  Marian Feldman's Diplomacy by Design examines the profound connection between art produced during this period and its social context, revealing inanimate objects as catalysts—or even participants—in human dynamics. Feldman's fascinating study shows the ways in which the exchange of these works of art actively mediated and strengthened political relations, intercultural interactions, and economic negotiations. Previous studies of this international style have focused almost exclusively on stylistic attribution at the expense of social contextualization. Written by a specialist in ancient Near Eastern art and archaeology who has excavated and traveled extensively in this area of the world, Diplomacy by Design provides a much broader consideration of the symbolic power of material culture and its centrality in the construction of human relations.},

Bringing together established and junior scholars from various areas, Ebla and Beyond aims at fostering the dialogue between experts in different fields of the history and archaeology of Syria in the Bronze and Iron Ages and between experienced foreign scholars and the latest generation of scholars of the School of Oriental Archaeology of Rome. The contributions in the book on the one hand show how much the discoveries at Ebla during forty-seven years of fieldwork have changed the way of understanding the developmental trajectory of Syria from the third through the first millennium BC. On the other hand, the work of the scholars from Rome and elsewhere proves how, even in difficult times for field archaeology, it is possible to exploit the results of a long-standing enterprise of this kind in a fruitful and sometimes revolutionary way},

  abstract = {The length of the human generation interval is a key parameter when using genetics to date population divergence events. However, no consensus exists regarding the generation interval length, and a wide variety of interval lengths have been used in recent studies. This makes comparison between studies difficult, and questions the accuracy of divergence date estimations. Recent genealogy-based research suggests that the male generation interval is substantially longer than the female interval, and that both are greater than the values commonly used in genetics studies. This study evaluates each of these hypotheses in a broader cross-cultural context, using data from both nation states and recent hunter-gatherer societies. Both hypotheses are supported by this study; therefore, revised estimates of male, female, and overall human generation interval lengths are proposed. The nearly universal, cross-cultural nature of the evidence justifies using these proposed estimates in Y-chromosomal, mitochondrial, and autosomal DNA-based population divergence studies.

Quelle che qui presentiamo sono le prime (saranno seguite da "Sei pezzi meno facili") e partono da zero. Nel primo "pezzo", dopo una breve introduzione ai metodi e al significato della ricerca - tre paginette che valgono intere biblioteche di testi epistemologici -, si dice di che cos'?? fatta la materia che cade sotto i nostri sensi: atomi in moto. Nel secondo si spiega che non tutto ?? cos?? limpido come sembra, e che nella materia c'?? anche dell'altro: il mondo quantistico e i suoi paradossi. Senza addentrarsi in una ricostruzione storica, Feynman riesce tuttavia a darci il senso dell'evolversi della fisica nel secolo appena trascorso, mettendone in luce i legami con le altre scienze. Gli ultimi tre saggi selezionano altrettanti capisaldi (energia, gravitazione, la realt?? quantistica), presentati a livelli di complessit?? crescente: a ogni lettura cade una buccia della magica cipolla e si apre un nuovo, affascinante scenario. Chi prevedesse di naufragare su un'isola deserta, e volesse esser certo di avere con s?? l'essenziale di quel che sappiamo sul mondo fisico, potr?? mettere nello zaino i "Sei pezzi facili".},

Despite superficial differences, both technologies are radically alike in depending not on static products but rather on continuous processes, not on "What?" but on "How do I get there?" In contrast to the fixed spatial organization of the page and book, the technologies of oral tradition and the Internet mime the way we think by processing along pathways within a network. In both media it's pathways--not things--that matter. To illustrate these ideas, this volume is designed as a "morphing book," a collection of linked nodes that can be read in innumerable different ways. Doing nothing less fundamental than challenging the default medium of the linear book and page and all that they entail, Oral Tradition and the Internet shows readers that there are large, complex, wholly viable, alternative worlds of media-technology out there--if only they are willing to explore, to think outside the usual, culturally constructed categories. This "brick-and-mortar" book exists as an extension of The Pathways Project (http://pathwaysproject.org), an open-access online suite of chapter-nodes, linked websites, and multimedia all dedicated to exploring and demonstrating the dynamic relationship between oral tradition and Internet technology},

  abstract = {Herbert Simon was the apostle of bounded rationality. He very often illustrated bounded rationality in the context of the theory of the firm, and was, of course, a major contributor to organizational theory. However, in spite of Simon’s efforts, I argue that bounded rationality has been only incompletely absorbed in the economics of organization, is little used for substantive purposes, and mostly serves a rhetorical function. In order to substantiate these claims, I discuss and compare alternative approaches to integrating bounded rationality with the theory of economic organization. I argue that in general bounded rationality is treated “thinly,” and is actually not necessary for producing the main insights of these theories. The paper ends with a brief discussion of how to proceed with integrating richer notions of bounded rationality with the theory of economic organization.},

We describe how the visual system can quickly extract broad statistics from a display, whereas poorly designed displays can lead to misperceptions and illusions. Extracting global statistics is fast, but comparing between subsets of values is slow. Effective graphics avoid taxing working memory, guide attention, and respect familiar conventions. Data visualizations can play a critical role in teaching and communication, provided that designers tailor those visualizations to their audience.},

  abstract = {Karl Polanyi started his career as a~doctor of law and practiced law for a~while; but he did not become a~legal scholar. As an economic historian, anthropologist, or sociologist, he was concerned with the relation of economy and society. But even though law is an important factor in mediating this relationship, Polanyi gave little attention to the law as such. As part of an endeavour to advance a~‘Polanyian’ economic sociology of law, this article develops the ‘law of market society’ as an analytical category. For this purpose, three argumentative strategies are combined. First, the article draws on The Great Transformation to reconstruct the role of law in the processes of commodification and decommodification. Second, it turns to Marxist scholarship to explore the conceptual link between law and economics and to ponder to what extent law itself can become a~commodity. Third, it links Polanyi’s approach with American institutionalism, and Commons’ work in particular, to show how the evolution of the ‘law of market society’ can also be understood as a~collective enterprise which continuously evolves. It is argued that these perspectives complement each other and help to bring the law back in where it is missing.},

  abstract = {Historical scholarship is currently undergoing a digital turn. All historians have experienced this change in one way or another, by writing on word processors, applying quantitative methods on digitalized source materials, or using internet resources and digital tools. Digital Histories showcases this emerging wave of digital history research. It presents work by historians who - on their own or through collaborations with e.g. information technology specialists - have uncovered new, empirical historical knowledge through digital and computational methods. The topics of the volume range from the medieval period to the present day, including various parts of Europe. The chapters apply an exemplary array of methods, such as digital metadata analysis, machine learning, network analysis, topic modelling, named entity recognition, collocation analysis, critical search, and text and data mining.The volume argues that digital history is entering a mature phase, digital history 'in action', where its focus is shifting from the building of resources towards the making of new historical knowledge. This also involves novel challenges that digital methods pose to historical research, including awareness of the pitfalls and limitations of the digital tools and the necessity of new forms of digital source criticisms.Through its combination of empirical, conceptual and contextual studies, Digital Histories is a timely and pioneering contribution taking stock of how digital research currently advances historical scholarship.},

  abstract = {Our civilization is rooted in the forms and innovations of societies that flourished more than six thousand years ago in distant lands of western Asia, extending from Egypt to India. The earliest of these societies was in the region known to the ancients as Mesopotamia, which occupies what is today Iraq, northeastern Syria, and southeastern Turkey. In Mesopotamia arose the first cities, and here urban institutions were invented and evolved. Writing was invented, monumental architecture in the form of temples and palaces were created, and the visual arts flowered in the service of religion and royalty. These extraordinary innovations profoundly affected surrounding areas in Anatolia, Syria-Levant, Iran, and the Gulf. Mesopotamia was influenced in turn by these outlying regions, for as networks of trade emerged they encouraged cultural exchange. This publication explores the artistic achievements of the era of the first cities in both the Mesopotamian heartland and across the expanse of western Asia. More than fifty experts in the field have contributed entries on individual works of art and essays covering a wide range of subjects. Among the objects presented are many that display the pure style of Mesopotamia, others from outlying regions that adapt from Mesopotamian models a corpus of forms and images, and still others that embody vital regional styles. Included are reliefs celebrating the accomplishments of kings and the pastimes of the elite; votive statues representing royal and other privileged persons; animal sculptures; and spectacular jewelry, musical instruments, and games found in tombs where kings, queens, and their servants were buried. -- Metropolitan Museum of Art website.},

  abstract = {In this article I attempt to improve the interpretation of the Eblaic text TM.75.G.756+ (published by Biga 2003), with a new examination. The text was originally divided into three parts separated by blanks. Subsequently, additions were traced on the dry clay in the cases initially left unwritten. The first part lists offerings probably intended to be placed in front of seven thrones for the astral divinities invoked in the rite (dGi₆-an). In this same part a black cloak for the kallatum dGi₆-an and seven women covered by a black cloak are mentioned. The first addition seems to belong to the textlinguistics ("Tablet of the (procedures) established"). The second part lists offerings to Gir(r)a (dNE-ra) and his companion Hapas (dA-ba-sa) "(Counter) witchcraft". The second addition, a self-standing section, indicates the number of the participants in the rite. The third part is a colophon indicating the occasion of the ritual ("in the occasion of the supplication of the king"). The tablet, as the administrative texts found in the same room L. 2712, must have been written in a period immediately preceding the destruction of the Palace G. The gods of the night are mentioned only in one other Eblaic document, an administrative text datable to the last period of the Archives. The ritual was probably introduced into Ebla in a very late period. Dans cet article, je tente d’améliorer l’interprétation du texte éblaique TM.75,G756+ (publié par Biga en 2003), suite à un nouvel examen. Le texte était originairement divisé en trois parties séparées par des blancs. Ultérieurement, des additions furent tracées sur l’argile sèche dans des cases laissées initialement non écrites. La première partie énumère des offrandes qu’on prévoyait probablement de placer devant les sept trônes des divinités astrales invoquées dans le rite (dGi₆-an). Dans la même partie, une cape noire pour la kallatum dGi₆-an et sept femmes couvertes par une cape noire sont mentionnées. La première addition semble appartenir au texte lui-même (“Tablettes des (procédures) établies”). La seconde partie énumère des offrandes à Gir(r)a (dNE-ra) et à son compagnon Hapas (da-ba-sa) ”(Contre) sorcellerie”. La seconde addition, une section indépendante, indique le nombre de participants au rite. La troisième partie est le colophon précisant l’occasion du rituel (“à l’occasion de la supplication du roi”). La tablette, ainsi que les textes administratifs trouvés dans la même pièce L.2712, ont dû être rédigés dans la période précédant immédiatement la destruction du palais G. Les dieux de la nuit sont seulement mentionnés dans un autre document éblaitique, un texte administratif datable de la dernière période des Archives. Le rituel a été probablement introduit à Ébla à une période tardive.},

Yet there are significant challenges to this view, most notably from postmodernism. In Historical Theory, a prominent historian develops a highly original argument that evaluates the diversity of approaches to history and points to a constructive way forward. Mary Fulbrook argues that all historians face key theoretical questions, and that an emphasis on the facts alone is not enough. Against postmodernism, she argures that historical narratives are not simply inventions imposed on the past, and that some answers to historical questions are more plausible or adequate than others. Illustrated with numerous substantive examples and its focus is always on the most central theoretical issues and on real strategies for bridging the gap between the traces of the past and the interpretations of the present. Historical Theory is essential and enlightening reading for all historians and their students.},

  abstract = {The three p53 family members, p53, p63 and p73, are structurally similar and share many biochemical activities. Yet, along with their common fundamental role in protecting genomic fidelity, each has acquired distinct functions related to diverse cell autonomous and non-autonomous processes. Similar to the p53 family, the Hippo signaling pathway impacts a multitude of cellular processes, spanning from cell cycle and metabolism to development and tumor suppression. The core Hippo module consists of the tumor-suppressive MST-LATS kinases and oncogenic transcriptional co-effectors YAP and TAZ. A wealth of accumulated data suggests a complex and delicate regulatory network connecting the p53 and Hippo pathways, in a highly context-specific manner. This generates multiple layers of interaction, ranging from interdependent and collaborative signaling to apparent antagonistic activity. Furthermore, genetic and epigenetic alterations can disrupt this homeostatic network, paving the way to genomic instability and cancer. This strengthens the need to better understand the nuances that control the molecular function of each component and the cross-talk between the different components. Here, we review interactions between the p53 and Hippo pathways within a subset of physiological contexts, focusing on normal stem cells and development, as well as regulation of apoptosis, senescence and metabolism in transformed cells.}

In this framework, knowledge claims about the past and anachronisms introduce no special epistemic problems for historiography, and once the logic of historical (re)description and evaluation is understood, historiography stands firm among the historical sciences in terms of the feasibility of its goal of speaking truthfully about the past.},

To exemplify the challenges facing the accounting historian, the author considers evidence on the Dreham archive, the temple as a financial institution, and the use of loans, interest and banking. Finally, the author suggests that the records of Ancient Mesopotamia offer a rich field of research in accounting history.},

W. Howitt. The article tracks the origins and dissemination of both genealogical methods and the crucial role of Indigenous agency in the development of field practices.

Each exhibits a critical and reflexive approach to bodily communication and to re-tracing bodies through the archaeological record (in art, the treatment of the body and material culture), and together they demonstrate the diversity of pioneering global research on gestures in archaeology and related disciplines, with contributions from leading researchers in Aegean, Mediterranean, Mesoamerican, Japanese and Near Eastern archaeology. By bringing case studies from each of these different cultures and regions together and drawing on interdisciplinary insights from anthropology, sociology, psychology, linguistics, design, art history and the performing arts, this volume reveals the similarities and differences in gestures as expressed in cultures around the world, and offers new and valuable perspectives on the nature of bodily communication across both space and time"--},

This approach is instrumental to the thesis of The Great Transformation concerning the destructive impact of the market on society. However, such an analytical perspective neglects the social character of the market economy. This perspective is also deficient in capturing why the market is destructive to the social fabric. By identifying the origins and limitations of Polanyi?s self-regulating market, this article contributes to critical reevaluations of his work that aim to expand the scope of Polanyian analysis. In particular, this article outlines how the analysis of the market?s contradictory place is not predicated on the notion of self-regulation. Polanyi?s own historical work, as opposed to his theoretical articulations, illustrates such an analysis.},

\par
“From at least the Old Babylonian period, the two gods were identified as one deity, Ḫendursanga in Sumerian contexts, Išum in Akkadian.” (George, 2015, p. 1)
\par
“an unpublished Late Babylonian fragment documented by copy and transliteration in the Nachlass of the late W. G. Lambert” (George, 2015, p. 1) Lambert's notes
\par
“\textsuperscript{d}PA” (George, 2015, p. 1) The logographic writing of ḫendur/Išum; means stick
\par
“The first learned name (l. 17) is restored to match Išum’s function, as recorded on amulets: \textsuperscript{d}\emph{i-šum} \emph{nāgir}(nimgir) \emph{sūqi}(sila), “I., herald of the street.”” (George, 2015, p. 2)
\par
“\textsuperscript{d}PA-bil-sag is here an error for \textsuperscript{d}PA-sag, i.e., Ḫendursanga” (George, 2015, p. 2)
\par
“the identification of Išum’s father as the sun-god, in agreement with the Old Babylonian narrative” (George, 2015, p. 2)
\par
“Išum’s learned names include, alongside Ḫendursanga, the epithet-names Nimgir-sila, “Herald of the Street,” Silaa-guenna, “Headman in the Street,” and Šul-gia-dudu, “Hero who Goes about at Night.”” (George, 2015, p. 2)
\par
“Most eloquent in defining the gods’ role as benign watchmen are the first-millennium amulet-type tablets that invoke “Išum, herald of the gods, lord of the street,” to protect the house and its occupants as he goes about his rounds” (George, 2015, p. 3)
\par
“the gods Šul-gia-dudu and En-gi-dudu were night watchmen.” (George, 2015, p. 4)
\par
“From this it follows that the light which the night watchmen Išum and Ḫendursanga shone to lead people home at night was a burning torch or firebrand.” (George, 2015, p. 4)
\par
“gi-izi-lá, “torch,”” (George, 2015, p. 4)
\par
“The phrase in question contains the word \emph{munattu}, “waking period,” a term often associated with dreams and divine revelation in Babylonian literature.” (George, 2015, p. 4)
\par
“This period of wakefulness or drowsingthe term is derived from a Semitic root meaning sleep (nwm)—was not necessarily at the end of the night; it could have been in the middle.” (George, 2015, p. 4)
\par
“Roger Ekirch’s study of nocturnal human activity in medieval and early modern Europe, \emph{At Day’s Close: A History of Nighttime}, reveals that it was common in days” (George, 2015, p. 4)

“before artificial lighting and nighttime entertainment for people to sleep in segments.” (George, 2015, p. 5)
\par
““First sleep” and “second sleep” were interrupted by a period during which people might drowse in bed or get up to pursue nocturnal activities.” (George, 2015, p. 5)
\par
“it was the task of the night watchman to provide a light for people to follow in the dark.” (George, 2015, p. 5)
\par
“literary composition that has most to say about Išum’s Sumerian counterpart, the hymn to Ḫendursanga.” (George, 2015, p. 5)
\par
“One passage makes it clear that his functions included patrolling the streets at night and opening the city gates at dawn” (George, 2015, p. 5)
\par
“A. Falkenstein proposed that this first element meant “staff,” in accordance with its logographic writing PA, “stick,” and following the ancient understanding witnessed by the epithet \emph{nāš ḫaṭṭi ṣīrti}, “who bears an august staff,” derived from Ḫendursanga’s name in Erra and Išum I 3.” (George, 2015, p. 6)
\par
“It seems likely that Ḫendursanga’s name derives from his function, as Falkenstein proposed: torch-bearer (ḫendur, “staff”) who goes in front (sag-gá, “of the head”). It then joins other names deriving from deified insignia.” (George, 2015, p. 6)
\par
“See G. J. Selz, “‘The holy drum, the spear, and the harp’: Towards an understanding of the problems of deification in third millennium Mesopotamia,” in Sumerian Gods and their Representations, ed. I. L. Finkel and M. J. Geller. Cuneiform Monographs 7 (Groningen, 1997), 167–213, esp. 171.” (George, 2015, p. 6)
\par
“Invoking the god’s name signifies that Babylonian night watchmen customarily uttered a few words to him on setting out.” (George, 2015, p. 6)
\par
“The allusion of the epithet en me-en sa7-ga is more certain: “the lovely tiara” that Ḫendursanga wears is certainly the flame of the night watchman’s torch.” (George, 2015, p. 7)
\par
“This passage reveals two important facts about Išum. As many have pointed out, the first line identifies his parents as the sun-god Šamaš and the goddess Ninlil (or Mulliltu).” (George, 2015, p. 7)
\par
“this was an irregular connection, and it made Išum at once son and great-grandson of Enlil’s spouse Ninlil.” (George, 2015, p. 7)
\par
“citing Michael Streck’s note on \emph{šutāḫuzu}, “to set alight,” in his study of the Akkadian Št\textsubscript{2} stem.” (George, 2015, p. 7)
\par
“What Ninlil did, having given birth to Išum, was to set him alight. The two lines are to be translated, “Ninlil bore Išum for Šamaš, then set (him alight) and left him in the street.”” (George, 2015, p. 7)
\par
“in this regard, Išum was a foundling, even though it was his aunt who ended up looking after him.” (George, 2015, p. 7)
\par
“M. P. Streck, “Funktionsanalyse des akkadischen Št\textsubscript{2}-Stamms,” \emph{ZA} 84 (1994): 161–67, esp. 166.” (George, 2015, p. 7)
\par
“the point here is that the fiery Išum was left in the street as a flame.” (George, 2015, p. 8)
\par
“This raises the prospect that Babylonian night watchmen not only carried lights as they walked, but also that they or other parties left lamps to light the paths of those out late at night.” (George, 2015, p. 8)
\par
“It is then possible to explain why Ištar, the sun’s sister, appears in the myth as Išum’s nurse. She calls her nephew “brother,” and so is herself cast in this scene as an unmarried girl.” (George, 2015, p. 8)
\par
“However, celestial Ištar was the planet Venus, which appears either at dusk as the Evening Star or at dawn as the Morning Star.” (George, 2015, p. 8)
\par
“hey provide evidence for the existence in ancient Mesopotamia of a social benefit to city-dwellers that is better known in more recent times.” (George, 2015, p. 8)
\par
“Paris followed suit in 1461. This is perhaps the model to be proposed for street-lighting in Babylonian cities: a local responsibility, rather than a municipal service, provided at the expense of the residents, not of any public administration.” (George, 2015, p. 8)
\par
“Street-lighting is unlikely to show up in the archaeological legacy of urban Mesopotamia or to have made much impact on the administrative record. People who are explicitly identified as street night watchmen rarely occur in the extant administrative documentation, unlike the personnel who saw to the security of palaces, temples and city gates.” (George, 2015, p. 8)
\par
“On ḫā’iṭum, “night watchman,” in Old Babylonian documents, see above, n. 18. A specific Akkadian term for “lamplighter” has been identified in the expression šārip nūri (CAD N/2 350a), which occurs in the apodosis of a liver-omen that compares part of the liver to the sign kud” (George, 2015, p. 8)},

Construit en pierres sèches avec des matériaux locaux, large en moyenne de 0,8 à 1,1 m et d'une hauteur qui ne devait pas dépasser 1 mou 1,5 m, il sépare les terres potentiellement exploitables par les sédentaires de celles dévolues principalement aupastoralisme itinérant. Considéré comme remontant à l'âge du Bronze ancien IV, il s'agirait d'un ouvrage limitatif, et non d'un ouvrage défensif marquant la « frontière » orientale d'un des royaumes -Hama, Ebla ? -du Croissant fertile à la fin du IIIe millénaire. Nous aurions donc là la plus ancienne matérialisation d'une limite de territoire qui soit connue à ce jour. In the Syrian steppe, a very long wall of over 220 km long was discovered east of Hama, drawing an arc facing to the east. Built in dry stone with local materials, it has an average width of 0.8 to 1.1 m and a height that was not exceeding 1 m or 1.5 m. The wall separates the area that is potentially exploitable by sedentary farmers from the one used by pastoralists. Considered going back to the Early Bronze Age IV, it seems to be a delineation of a limit, and not a defensive structure, marking the eastern border of the kingdoms of Hama or Ebla in the Fertile Crescent at the end of the 3rd millennium. We would therefore have the oldest materialization of a territorial boundary that is currently known to us.},

  abstract = {Kassite Babylonia counts among the great powers of the Late Bronze Age Near East. Its kings exchanged diplomatic letters with the pharaohs of Egypt and held their own against their Assyrian and Elamite neighbors. Babylonia's internal workings, however, remain understood in their outlines only, as do its elite's expansionary ambitions, the degrees to which they may have been realized, and the nature of ensuing imperial encounters. This is especially the case for the region to the northeast, where the Mesopotamian lowlands meet the Zagros piedmonts in the Diyala River valley and where a series of corridors of movement intersect to form a strategic highland-lowland borderland. In this paper, we present critical new results of regional survey in the Upper Diyala plains of northeast Iraq and excavations at the Late Bronze Age site of Khani Masi. Not only do our data and analyses expand considerably the known extent of Babylonia's cultural sphere, but also the monumental character of Khani Masi and its wider settlement context prompt a fundamental rethinking of the nature and chronology of Babylonian presence in this transitional landscape. As such, this paper contributes an important new case study to the field of archaeological empire and borderland studies.},

The sociological literature on time remains solipsistically empirical, while theoretical elaborations are focused on modernity, capitalism, and technology, through notions of speed and acceleration. Although existing studies on time are imbued with political issues and processes, as the subfield that studies relations of power and politics, political sociology has yet to consolidate a temporal lexicon for studying structures of power and political phenomena. This review situates three recent books on time and politics within a broader sociological literature on time and calls for a political sociology of time. I argue that developing a conceptual apparatus that takes time as an element of power is fundamental to building dialogue across the empirical material and across disciplines. I conclude by offering three avenues for the development of a political sociology of time.},

The graph will then be split into classes maximizing modularity, that is to say, into clusters optimally composed by personal identifications that statistically tend to connect more inside each cluster than with personal identifications of other clusters. Finally, this will be used to raise or lower the probability of stating that pairs of identifications of the type 'ZZZ, son of YYY' and 'YYY' may correspond respectively to a son and his father.},

This article asks broadly whether a form of hauntology has emerged within anthropology; if so, when and how it has appeared; and what constitutes such a field as distinctive. This article asks what comprises being haunted as a specific affective state within anthropological writing, what theory of the subject is assumed by such writings, and what distinguishes ethnographic analyses that do not dismiss the presence of ghosts as simply cultural beliefs or literary fictions, as is common in cultural studies. It reviews the literature on the haunting remains of traumatic violence, examines writing that juxtaposes hauntological and ontological theorizing, describes the appearance of an incipient hauntological voice within ethnographic writing, and concludes with a discussion of the emergence of a hauntological ethics.},

  abstract = {This book is an attempt to see the development of domestic institutions, the family, marriage, conjugal roles, in relation to changes in the mode of productive activity, and specifically with the change from hoe to plough agriculture. These differences are related to societies in Africa on the one hand, and in Asia and Europe on the other. The author tries to do this in two ways. He compares information derived from a range of human societies, historical as well as contemporary, employing the impressionistic techniques of the social scientist and comparative historian. But in addition, he has tried to make systematic use of material on a range of world societies, coded in the Ethnographic Atlas. In the main chapters of the book, the author examines general features of the network of traditional social roles found in these two continental areas of the Old World. He discusses the reasons why Europe and Asia should stress marriage within the social group, monogamous unions as well as the roles of concubine, step-parent, spinster and adopted child, whereas in Africa, the emphasis is on marriage outside the group, polygyny and co-wives. Similar differences emerge in a range of other features, including the division of labour by sex. Behind all these lie differences in the systems of agriculture and the nature of the social hierarchies which they support. Professor Goody is firmly committed to the idea that the social sciences have no alternative but to be comparative and explicitly historical if they are to contribute to the serious causal analysis of fundamental features of social organisation and development. His broad and ambitious book will appeal to anyone with a professional interest in social sciences - historians, anthropologists, sociologists, geographers and economists.},

  abstract = {This book assesses the impact of writing on human societies, both in the Ancient Near East and in twentieth-century Africa, and highlights some general features of social systems that have been influenced by this major change in the mode of communication. Such features are central to any attempt at the theoretical definition of human society and such constituent phenomena as religious and legal systems, and in this study Professor Goody explores the role of a specific mechanism, the introduction of writing and the development of a written tradition, in the explanation of some important social differences and similarities. Goody argues that a shift of emphasis from productive to certain communicative processes is essential to account adequately for major changes in human societies. Whilst there have been previous descussions of the effect of literacy upon social organisation, no study has hitherto presented the general synthesis developed here.},

  abstract = {The East in the West reassesses Western views of Asia. Traditionally many European historians and theorists have seen the societies of the East as 'static' or 'backward'. Jack Goody challenges these assumptions, beginning with the notion of a special Western rationality which enabled 'us' and not 'them' to modernise. He then turns to book-keeping, which several social and economic historians have seen as intrinsic to capitalism, arguing that there was in fact little difference between East and West in terms of mercantile activity. Other factors said to inhibit the East's development, such as the family and forms of labour, have also been greatly exaggerated. This Eurocentrism both fails to explain the current achievements of the East, and misunderstands Western history. The East in the West starts to redress the balance, and so marks a fundamental shift in our view of Western and Eastern history and society.},

  abstract = {Professor Jack Goody builds on his own previous work to extend further his highly influential critique of what he sees as the pervasive eurocentric or occidentalist biases of so much western historical writing.  Goody also examines the consequent 'theft' by the West of the achievements of other cultures in the invention of (notably) democracy, capitalism, individualism, and love. The Theft of History discusses a number of theorists in detail, including Marx, Weber and Norbert Elias, and engages with critical admiration western historians like Fernand Braudel, Moses Finlay and Perry Anderson. Major questions of method are raised, and Goody proposes a new comparative methodology for cross-cultural analysis, one that gives a much more sophisticated basis for assessing divergent historical outcomes, and replaces outmoded simple differences between East and West. The Theft of History will be read by an unusually wide audience of historians, anthropologists and social theorists.},

Roth's The Philosophical Structure of Historical Explanation follows Roth in accepting the notion of a “narrative sentence” (from Danto's Analytical Philosophy of History) and takes up Roth's view that a narrative explanation elucidates that which it constructs. I also analyze the “relating of events” within a temporal frame, but I come to different conclusions than Roth does: I deny any necessary connection between a narrative explanation and a narrative sentence and object to Roth's insistence on “nonstandardization” as a necessary feature of a narrative explanation. I argue that a “passage of time” is characteristic of all our descriptions, regardless of whether they are scientific, historical, or anything else. Like Roth, I draw on the work of W. V. O. Quine to address the pragmatic question of how large a “unit of empirical significance” is to be, and I show that different practical situations may require different practical decisions about what sizes of unit are required, with whole narratives being units of significance in themselves. Problems of the epistemic structure of narratives remain, and I argue that relating a passage of time requires a theory that enables us to preclude any temporal gaps. A theory of conceptual linkage of any stripe seems incapable of doing that.},

  abstract = {Analysis of social networks is suggested as a tool for linking micro and macro levels of sociological theory. The procedure is illustrated by elaboration of the macro implications of one aspect of small-scale interaction: the strength of dyadic ties. It is argued that the degree of overlap of two individuals' friendship networks varies directly with the strength of their tie to one another. The impact of this principle on diffusion of influence and information, mobility opportunity, and community organization is explored. Stress is laid on the cohesive power of weak ties. Most network models deal, implicitly, with strong ties, thus confining their applicability to small, well-defined groups. Emphasis on weak ties lends itself to discussion of relations between groups and to analysis of segments of social structure not easily defined in terms of primary groups.},

The formation of the marriage contract may have involved the performance of symbolic rites and the recitation of traditional verbal formulas; there is particularly significant evidence for the latter. Recitation of verba solemnia by the bride as well as by the groom is not notionally in conflict with the patriarchal character of the Babylonian family. (Appendix: These Old Babylonian findings provide a basis for criticism of the prevailing understanding of the Ur III marriage contracts, particularly with respect to a reconstruction of two separate types of marriage agreements.)},

This article deals with the bridewealth gifts which are described by the terms nigmussa, nigdea, and mupad(d)a. These gifts consisted almost exclusively of foodstuffs; they were contributions to the feasts that were customarily held to celebrate a marriage. Bridewealth gifts of foodstuffs are attested in numerous archival sources from everyday life dating back to the Fara period; they are also attested in cult and myth, in connection with the ritual marriages of gods and goddesses. These foodstuffs were, typically, sent by the groom and his relatives to the house of the bride during the time after betrothal agreements were made and prior to the wedding. Parallels to the Sumerian custom are seen in Semitic marriage practices which are reflected in documents coming from Ebla, as well as from Greater Mesopotamia during the Old Akkadian period.},

What were their tasks, and what was their position within the royal household and in relation to the king and his family? What departments were in place, and who were the managers? What was the role of lower-ranking personnel within this system? The study also investigates the social and cultural background of the personnel as well as their professional life, including their financial means, the quantity and type of their remuneration, and their career progression. Envisaged also as reference book, the book provides a prosopographical catalogue of the wide range of personnel discussed. As the personal household of the sovereign and the administrative and political centre of the empire, this study of the royal household opens up the immediate environment of the king and his family, but also to the governmental apparatus of the empire as a whole.0.},

  abstract = {To support the sharing and reuse of formally represented knowledge among AI systems, it is useful to define the common vocabulary in which shared knowledge is represented. A specification of a representational vocabulary for a shared domain of discourse—definitions of classes, relations, functions, and other objects—is called an ontology. This paper describes a mechanism for defining ontologies that are portable over representation systems. Definitions written in a standard format for predicate calculus are translated by a system called Ontolingua into specialized representations, including frame-based systems as well as relational languages. This allows researchers to share and reuse ontologies, while retaining the computational benefits of specialized implementations. We discuss how the translation approach to portability addresses several technical problems. One problem is how to accommodate the stylistic and organizational differences among representations while preserving declarative content. Another is how to translate from a very expressive language into restricted languages, remaining system-independent while preserving the computational efficiency of implemented systems. We describe how these problems are addressed by basing Ontolingua itself on an ontology of domain-independent, representational idioms.},

  abstract = {The field of stratification is being transformed and reshaped by advances in theory and quantitative modeling as well as by new approaches to the analysis of economic, racial, and gender inequality. Although these developments are revolutionary in their implications, until now there has been no comprehensive effort to bring together the classic articles that have defined and redefined the contours of the field.In this up-to-date anthology, the history of stratification research unfolds in systematic fashion, with the introductory articles in each section providing examples of the major research traditions in the field and the concluding essays (commissioned from leading scholars) providing broader programmatic statements that identify current controversies and unresolved issues. The resulting collection of articles both celebrates the diversity of theoretical approaches and reveals the cumulative nature of ongoing research.This comprehensive reader is designed as a primary text for introductory courses on social stratification and as a supplementary text for advanced courses on social classes, occupations, labor markets, or social mobility. The following types of questions and debates are addressed in the six sections of the reader:1. Is stratification inevitable? Do the recent "experiments with destratification in Eastern Europe and elsewhere provide new insights into the functionalist theory of inequality?2. Can we identify a set of organized and cohesive "social classes" in advanced industrial societies? Does it make sense to refer to a ruling class, a "political class," or a "power elite" in these societies?3. Are the basic contours of occupational mobility the same within all advanced industrial societies? Have the "new structuralists" led us astray in our attempts to understand the sources and causes of occupational attainment?4. Are there fundamental differences across social classes in styles of life, patterns of consumption, and attitudes toward work? Are these "class-specific cultures" attenuating as we move into advanced industrialism?5. Is there an emerging underclass in America? What are the principal sources of racial, ethnic, and gender inequality?6. Can we identify a "teleological dynamic" driving the development of stratification systems? Are new forms of stratification and inequality emerging as Eastern Europe enters its postsocialist stage?The volume offers essential reading for undergraduates who need an introduction to the field, for graduate students who wish to broaden their understanding of stratification research, and for advanced scholars who seek a basic reference guide. Although most of the selections are middle-range theoretical pieces suitable for introductory courses, the anthology also includes advanced contributions on the cutting edge of research. The editor outlines a modified study plan for undergraduate students requiring a basic introduction to the field.},

How can one explain the different appraisal of certain things in different temporal horizons and in different cultures? Cultural processes on how value is attached to things, and how value is re-established, are still little understood. The case studies in this volume, originating from anthropology and archaeology, provide innovative and differentiated answers to these questions. However, for all contributions there are some common basic assumptions. One of these concerns the understanding that it is rarely the value of the material itself that matters for high valuation, but rather the appreciation of the (assumed or constructed) origin of certain objects or their connection with certain social structures. A second of these shared insights addresses the ubiquity of phenomena of 'value in things'. There is no society without valued objects. As a rule, valuation is something negotiated or even disputed. Value arises through social action, whereby it is always necessary to ask anew which actors are interested in the value of certain objects (or in their appreciation). This also works the other way round: Who are those actors who question corresponding objective values and why?"--},

The interplay of gender, identity, textile production and use is notable on many levels, from the question of who was involved in the transformation of raw materials into fabric at one end, to the wearing of garments and the construction of identity at the other. Textile production has often been considered to follow a linear trajectory from a domestic (female) activity to a more 'commercial' or 'industrial' (male-centred) mode of production. In reality, many modes of production co-existed and the making of textiles is not so easily grafted onto the labour of one sex or the other. Similarly, textiles once transformed into garments are often of 'unisex' shape but worn to express the gender of the wearer. As shown by the detailed textual source material and the rich illustrations in this volume, dress and gender are intimately linked in the visual and written records of antiquity. The contributors show how it is common practice in both art and literature not only to use particular garments to characterize one sex or the other, but also to undermine characterizations by suggesting that they display features usually associated with the opposite gender"--},

The creation of new cities was imagined as an ideological project or a divine intervention in the political narratives and mythologies of Near Eastern cultures, often masking the complex processes behind the social production of urban space. During the Early Iron Age (c.1200–850 BCE), Assyrian and Syro-Hittite rulers developed a highly performative official discourse that revolved around constructing cities, cultivating landscapes, building watercourses, erecting monuments and initiating public festivals. This volume combs through archaeological, epigraphic, visual, architectural and environmental evidence to tell the story of a region from the perspective of its spatial practices, landscape history and architectural technologies. It argues that the cultural processes of the making of urban spaces shape collective memory and identity as well as sites of political performance and state spectacle.¡/p¿...},

Beginning with an article by Tumin in 1953, the Davis-Moore theory elicited regular analysis, commentary, criticism, and debate through the 1970s. Although professional work on the theory has largely ceased since the late 1980s, the Davis-Moore theory remains perhaps the single most widely cited paper in American introductory sociology and stratification textbooks and constitutes “required reading” in hundreds, if not thousands, of undergraduate and graduate courses throughout the United States. The present paper traces the history of the debate and attempts to explain the theory’s longevity and vitality in the face of what has amounted to largely negative assessments by other sociologists over the preceding fifty years.},

However, the role of climate change in the “collapse” of eastern Mediterranean Bronze Age societies has been questioned due to the resolution of climate proxy records. In this paper we present a regional synthesis of the highest resolution palaeoclimate records and compare these to archaeological evidence. By recalibrating radiocarbon dates onto a consistent timescale and using pollen, oxygen and carbon isotopes from both marine and terrestrial deposits, we reconstruct aridity at a 50-year resolution. Our results challenge a simple “climate destroyed society” hypothesis. Instead, we find a more complex record of changing aridity and societal response and provide a nuanced perspective on climate versus non-climate causes of Bronze Age societal “collapse” events. Our results have implications for the generation of palaeoclimate records aimed at exploring links between climate and societal change, emphasising the need for high resolution records proximal to archaeological sites.},

  abstract = {Central Anatolia in the Middle Bronze Age is marked by an extremely well-documented Assyrian presence during the kārum period (20th-mid 17th c. B.C.),1 a dynamic time of long-distance trade and cultural contact.2 Many Assyrians settled here on a permanent or semi-permanent basis, some marrying locals and raising children in their Anatolian homes, but also maintaining close contact with their home city of Aššur, following business interests and family affairs there. One of the idiosyncrasies of the social history of this period is a special bigamous arrangement which allowed Assyrian men to enter second marriages on the condition that one wife remained at home in Aššur, and the other in Anatolia. So far unattested for other contemporary or later Mesopotamian societies, this appears to be a custom peculiar to Old Assyrian society, designed to accommodate the needs of its travelling men (Michel 2006: 163). The potential role of Anatolian agency3 in the formation of this new custom, however, is seldom considered, despite numerous marriage contracts featuring mixed Assyro-Anatolian couples. This is partly due to the nature of the textual record, which offers very little of the kind of information one would require for reconstructing default conditions for Anatolian marriage practices, or gauging the extent to which these may have differed from Assyrian customs. While it is inevitable that discussions of kārum period marriage rely mostly on the Assyrian perspective, it would be a mistake to accord to it full explanatory capacity for how marriage practices took shape in mixed Assyro-Anatolian communities. Arguably certain aspects of long-distance bigamy cannot be explained as prioritising Assyrian needs, but instead suggest compromise. In other words, in generating a new legal mechanism of second marriages, Assyrians were not simply adapting to the logistics of long-distance life, but also to a new set of social expectations. As already noted by Lumsden (2008) and recently reiterated by Larsen and Lassen (2014), the nexus of intermarriage and cross-cultural compromise aligns Assyro- Anatolian marriage with R. White’s (2011) model of the ‘middle ground.’ This article tests the extent to which a middle ground may be recognisable in Assyro-Anatolian marriage practices, and how the peculiar terminology of bigamous arrangements can be interpreted as the crucial element of misunderstanding (White 2011) in middle ground formation.},

  abstract = {Since the subject of traffic dynamics has captured the interest of physicists, many astonishing effects have been revealed and explained. Some of the questions now understood are the following: Why are vehicles sometimes stopped by so-called ``phantom traffic jams'', although they all like to drive fast? What are the mechanisms behind stop-and-go traffic? Why are there several different kinds of congestion, and how are they related? Why do most traffic jams occur considerably before the road capacity is reached? Can a temporary reduction of the traffic volume cause a lasting traffic jam? Under which conditions can speed limits speed up traffic? Why do pedestrians moving in opposite directions normally organize in lanes, while similar systems are ``freezing by heating''? Why do self-organizing systems tend to reach an optimal state? Why do panicking pedestrians produce dangerous deadlocks? All these questions have been answered by applying and extending methods from statistical physics and non-linear dynamics to self-driven many-particle systems. This review article on traffic introduces (i) empirically data, facts, and observations, (ii) the main approaches to pedestrian, highway, and city traffic, (iii) microscopic (particle-based), mesoscopic (gas-kinetic), and macroscopic (fluid-dynamic) models. Attention is also paid to the formulation of a micro-macro link, to aspects of universality, and to other unifying concepts like a general modelling framework for self-driven many-particle systems, including spin systems. Subjects such as the optimization of traffic flows and relations to biological or socio-economic systems such as bacterial colonies, flocks of birds, panics, and stock market dynamics are discussed as well.},

Yet little is known about the structure of human genealogies over long periods of time and how they depart from expectations of standard demographic models, such as that attributed to Wright and Fisher. To obtain such information and to examine the recent evolutionary history of mtDNA and Y-chromosome haplotypes in the Icelandic gene pool, we traced the matrilineal and patrilineal ancestry of all 131,060 Icelanders born after 1972 back to two cohorts of ancestors, one born between 1848 and 1892 and the other between 1798 and 1742. This populationwide coalescent analysis of Icelandic genealogies revealed highly positively skewed distributions of descendants to ancestors, with the vast majority of potential ancestors contributing one or no descendants and a minority of ancestors contributing large numbers of descendants. The expansion and loss of matrilines and patrilines has caused considerable fluctuation in the frequencies of mtDNA and Y-chromosome haplotypes, despite a rapid population expansion in Iceland during the past 300 years. Contrary to a widespread assumption, the rate of evolution caused by this lineage-sorting process was markedly faster in matrilines (mtDNA) than in patrilines (Y chromosomes). The primary cause is a 10\% shorter matrilineal generation interval. Variance in the number of offspring produced within each generation was not an important differentiating factor. We observed an intergenerational correlation in offspring number and in the length of generation intervals in the matrilineal and patrilineal genealogies, which was stronger in matrilines and thus contributes to their faster evolutionary rate. These findings may have implications for coalescent date estimates based on mtDNA and Y chromosomes.},

Hirschman here offers a new interpretation for the rise of capitalism, one that emphasizes the continuities between old and new, in contrast to the assumption of a sharp break that is a common feature of both Marxian and Weberian thinking.

This is what I call a historiography that goes beyond factual events to consider the possible alternative interpretations of the course of history without entering the field of counterfactual history. In contrast to counterfactual history, which asks what else could have happened, virtual historiography asks how the past would be seen if it had led to another future. For such a historiographical project, the article offers a set of conceptual tools that allow possible alternative courses of events in the past and present to be brought to the attention of contemporary historians: the concept of time figures for presenting a typology of the temporal directions of historical change (part 1); the concept of the future as a generator of time figures (part 2); the concepts of past futures for developments alternative to the factual course of history and of future pasts for visions of the present state of affairs seen from a future point of view (part 3). In part 4, I outline the significance of these concepts for a virtual historiography, and in part 5, I draw conclusions for the political use and the scale of time implicit in such a design of history.},

In other highly influential publications on this issue, critical rationalism has been regarded as merely a small and superficial improvement of naive positivism (post-positivism; e.g. Guba \& Lincoln, 1994). In contrast, we argue that Popper was a staunch anti-positivist and that his approach is much closer to the epistemological beliefs that seem to underlie most of qualitative research. Beyond a mere pragmatism in doing whatever is useful, critical rationalism could serve as a guiding epistemology for all social scientific research as long as all aspects of the methodological approach are open to pertinent criticism themselves.},

In keeping with the American Heritage tradition of cutting-edge research, the Fifth Edition represents the work of a dedicated team of experts, scholars, and contributors. Thousands of definitions have been revised in rapidly changing fields such as astronomy and biology, geographical entries and maps have been completely updated, and the dictionary’s signature feature notes on word history, synonymy, and language variation have been enhanced and improved.  Trustworthy advice on controversies and conundrums in English usage is provided by the American Heritage Usage Panel, a group of 200 prominent users of the language. Under the leadership of Steven Pinker, preeminent researcher on language and the mind, the Panel passes judgment on both new and longstanding usage problems. No other dictionary offers such discerning and helpful guidance on issues of usage, grammar, and style.  Word meanings are made easier to understand with thousands of new quotations from classic and contemporary writers. Etymologies explaining word origins and development have been newly created or revised to reflect the very latest scholarship. Many words are traced back to their roots in prehistory through two unique appendixes showing word roots in ancient Indo-European and Semitic.

Information on menstrual status, infant supplementation, socio-economic status and anthropometric measurements was collected for lactating women with infants 13-21 months of age. The median length of amenorrhoea was observed to be over 18 months. There was a higher probability of being amenorrhoeic for older women and those of lower socio-economic status. Maternal malnutrition extended the duration of amenorrhoea slightly. Women feeding their infants higher-quality supplements were less likely to be amenorrhoeic than those supplying their infants with less adequate supplements. The figures suggest that the pattern of breastfeeding plays the primary role in determining lengths of lactational amenorrhoea for this rural population.},

It is historical on account of its recursive basis for action: its systems turn to prior beliefs—often through multiple steps or layers—to make recommendations for the present or predictions for the future. Using the two rooms approach of Alan Turing's imitation game, I highlight the potential for machine and human histories to be recognized via at least the idea of weak artificial intelligence. This recognition illuminates the mixed nature of the logic of history, combining deductions and endoxa. Finally, I note that illuminating and exploring this mixed logic of history signals a turn to historiographical metaphysics with Aristotelian features and, thus, the recognition of histories by professional historians as only part of a historiographical world. This signals that the recognition of machine and human history makers does not simply turn on the acknowledgement of imitation.},

Through the comparison of the statistical properties of different samples of hacksilver and balance weights from various contexts of the Near Eastern Bronze Age, the study attempts to assess whether the weight values of bullion-currencies can be expected to comply with existing weight-standards. The results of the statistical analyses on a silver hoard from Ebla (Syria) strongly suggest that hacksilver in the Bronze Age Near East was shaped and/or fragmented in order to comply with the weight-systems that were in use in the trade networks where it circulated. The results also show the possibility to quantify the level of affinity between different weight-systems. The study is intended to provide a starting point for future research, aimed at the identification of different forms of bullion-currencies in pre- and protohistoric economies.},

One of its key features is the ability to display the spatialization process, aiming at transforming the network into a map, and ForceAtlas2 is its default layout algorithm. The latter is developed by the Gephi team as an all-around solution to Gephi users’ typical networks (scale-free, 10 to 10,000 nodes). We present here for the first time its functioning and settings. ForceAtlas2 is a force-directed layout close to other algorithms used for network spatialization. We do not claim a theoretical advance but an attempt to integrate different techniques such as the Barnes Hut simulation, degree-dependent repulsive force, and local and global adaptive temperatures. It is designed for the Gephi user experience (it is a continuous algorithm), and we explain which constraints it implies. The algorithm benefits from much feedback and is developed in order to provide many possibilities through its settings. We lay out its complete functioning for the users who need a precise understanding of its behaviour, from the formulas to graphic illustration of the result. We propose a benchmark for our compromise between performance and quality. We also explain why we integrated its various features and discuss our design choices.},

However, analysing archives as a whole by (re)constructing files and dossiers is the only way to make sense with documents of different natures, as they were sorted, filed, and kept by those who produced them. After a general presentation of the Old Babylonian archival documentation, this paper investigates the function and motivation of family archives and archival documents, introducing another typological distinction : among the large mass of sealed documents, which record the responsibility of persons regarding authority, whether legal or administrative, we should distinguish between documents of limited validity, recording temporary arrangements between persons, and documents of unlimited validity establishing permanent status of persons and properties, which compose the core of Old Babylonian family archives. A third class of archival texts, without any sealings, served other purposes in the archives, recording the memory of domestic bookkeeping or of archival activities as such.},

  abstract = {In Zeitgärten: Zeitfiguren in der Geschichte der Neuzeit, Lucian Hölscher distinguishes between an embodied time and an empty time. Simply put, an embodied time includes histories, while its counterpart includes only dates and chronologies. He prefers the latter, for it offers an alternative to Reinhart Koselleck's idea of different layers of time. According to Hölscher, historians can achieve more unity in history through his empty temporality than through Koselleck's time of various speeds. Hölscher connects time with space to form a framework that, in addition to eras, chronologies, years, dates, and so on, especially includes time patterns, which he calls Zeitfiguren. These time figures form the infrastructure of all kinds of historiography, as Hölscher shows through his analysis of the studies of twenty German and four non-German authors. He exposes patterns such as progress, acceleration, and discontinuity, which form the building blocks of a philosophy of history based on the aforementioned empty time. Despite his criticism of Koselleck's ideas about time layers, Hölscher continues to follow in his footsteps, especially concerning his time of two levels, his future-oriented time, and his analytical, nonlinguistic method, which neglects absolute presuppositions. That's a pity, but what is positive is Hölscher's invention and thorough explanation of time figures.},

In addition to two weighted versions of the one-mode co-occurrence network, the dataset also contains a two-mode person-text network and rich metadata for each individual. For the first time, the dataset allows large-scale computational analysis of social structures in the Assyrian Empire.

The tablets comprise literary, magic, and divinatory texts, as well as fifteen Middle and Neo-Babylonian school manuscripts with excerpts from various compositions.  The literary texts include a large prayer invoking blessings of Nippur gods upon the king, known in other cities as well; a wisdom monologue, and a manuscript of The Exaltation of Ištar. The magic section includes Middle Babylonian versions of anti-witchcraft incantations previously known in the first millennium, as well as exorcistic spells, and formulas to be recited upon the consecration of Nippur priests. Extispicy, hemerologies, and physiognomy are among the divinatory texts edited. The school tablets contain excerpts from several texts previously unknown to have survived into the respective periods, such as a Middle Babylonian version of Tamarisk and Palm and a first-millennium version of the wisdom text Hearken to the Advice. The introduction of the book contains an overview of Nippur history, as well as a discussion of the provenance of the tablets and their social and school contexts. The city of Nippur, whose scholarly production circulated widely in Antiquity, is strangely bereft of scholarly manuscripts, a fact that the book seeks to explain.},

Since only some individuals within the major institutions received meat rations (and multiple portions are closely linked to the highest levels within these hierarchies), the identification of this metric and its metrology within the Late Uruk documentation is of central importance to the question of Late Uruk diacritical feasting. Unlike feast ledgers such as MSVO 1, 93, which document how various different economic sectors contributed to a single festive event, the Late Uruk accountants were also rather fond of second-order descriptions of meat distributions, what we might these days see as a kind of auditing. These auditing records focus exclusively on the distribution of portions of meat and seem to be rooted in the organisation and hierarchy of individual offices within a concrete institution. For lack of a better name, we can refer to this unnamed entity as the UKKIN institution on the basis of a well-known lexical list that seems to have originated as its organisational plan},

Stocking, Jr.), political theory (e.g. Quentin Skinner), and, more recently, in sociology. It is thus possible to speak optimistically of a "new history of sociology" that is, in Merton's phrase, "authentically historical." A summary of this literature is presented. Since the value of this new history for sociology itself is avowedly different from that of its "systematic" counterpart, the alternative functions of "authentic histories" of sociology are discussed in the conclusion.},

  abstract = {Rationality has been recognized as perhaps the major theme in Max Weber's oeuvre. The commentators who have addressed this theme have generally constricted its polymorphous character. This article inventories Weber's usage of "rationality" and "rationalization" in "Economy and Society" and the "Collected Essays in the Sociology of Religion." Four types of rationality are identified and compared with one another: practical, theoretical, substantive, and formal. Only "ethical substantive rationality" introduces methodical ways of life. All four types become manifest in a multiplicity of rationalization processes orchestrated at all levels of societal and civilization process. Long-term rationalization processes are seen to be rooted in values rather than in interests. The dominance of practical, theoretical, and formal rationalization processes in modern Western societies implies immense consequences for the type of person likely to live in these societies.},

Nevertheless, archaeologists have tended to ignore prehistoric children, perhaps viewing them as only peripheral to central research concerns, or to treat them stereotypically. The archaeological record provides opportunities for the exploration of numerous aspects of childhood and archaeologists are encouraged to respond to the challenge.},

The main title of the book, The Rod and Measuring Rope, alludes to the honoree's architectural background and to his characteristic great attention to details and exactness in teaching and research, and the contributors to his Festschrift are colleagues, friends, and former students. Reflecting the broad interests of the honoree, the contributions vary in terms of subject (ranging e.g. from notes on grammar to plans of archaeological reconstruction), source type (e.g. with contributions both on research history and based on the analysis of ancient sources), time period (ranging from the Early Dynastic period down to the Neo-Assyrian period), and geography (including e.g. Egypt, Syria, and Iran, beside Sumer, Assyria, and Babylonia). Not only papers in Assyriology can be found in the book but also ones rooted in Near Eastern Archaeology, Egyptology, and Biblical and Graeco-Roman studies. Because of this inclusivity, this book will be of use to readers focused on Assyriology as well as to those centred on related disciplines and to those generally interested in the Ancient Near East. The book is richly illustrated with images, drawings, and graphs},

Recent events have confirmed that money is only a useful tool in economic exchange if it is trusted, and this is a concept that this text explores in depth. The international panel of experts assembled here offers a long-range perspective, from ancient Assyria to modern societies in Europe, China and the US. This book will be of interest to students and researchers of economic history, and to anyone who seeks to understand the economic crises of recent decades, and place them in a wider historical context. --},

  abstract = {In recent years, scholars from across the humanities, including literary critics Stephen Best and Saidiya Hartman, have theorized about how best to account for the silences endemic to the archive of American slavery. These critics call for a shift away from what Best has described as a “logic and ethic of recovery” to a new focus, instead, on animating the mysteries of the past. With the example of James Hemings, Thomas Jefferson’s enslaved chef (and Sally Hemings’s older brother), this essay shows how a set of techniques associated with the digital humanities—in particular, techniques that derive from the fields of computational linguistics and data visualization—can further illuminate these mysteries. It also describes how the unique demands of the archive of slavery pose challenges to the field of digital humanities as it is currently conceived. By contrasting a set of visualizations of Hemings’s archival trace with Jefferson’s own charts and tables, Klein demonstrates how we must rethink the empiricist epistemology of the visible that endures to this day. After a brief discussion of data visualization as it relates to the construction of race, Klein turns to the issue of labor, and concludes that Hemings’s culinary labor, when considered as techne, can inform discussions of digital labor today.},

  abstract = {This chapter discusses the use and abuse of the world systems theory. Fried's concept of a pristine social formation or society considered almost in isolation from other societies has been criticized as never operative or too ideal and misleading a type to be useful. Whether one prefers to refer to peer polity, cluster, or some other form of intersocietal interaction, the basic fact remains that the development or cultural evolution of any society is dependent upon its relations with other societies; that cultures are open, not closed, systems; and that studies, be they based on excavations of a site or settlement data from surveys of precisely defined, well-demarcated, but bounded areas, that fail to consider broader patterns of interaction are necessarily incomplete and partial. The modern world system is distinguished by primarily economic as opposed to political, cultural, or presumably even ideological linkages among its constituent parts. Political diversity, primacy of the economic sphere, and control and development of a technology capable of supporting and expanding such a system are the critical variables, according to Wallerstein, that distinguish the modern era from ancient and medieval times. The modern world system is also characterized by a highly complex global division of labor that results in major regional differences; some areas become exporters of primary resources, while others produce and successfully market.},

  abstract = {The concept of generation can be defined with regard to society or to family – two levels which are usually analyzed separately but should be treated in a unified framework. At the level of the family, generation refers to position in the lineage (filiation). At the societal level, it refers to the aggregate of persons born in a limited period (i.e., a birth cohort according to demographic parlance) who therefore experience historical events at similar ages and move up through the life course in unison. At both levels, the concept of generation is a key to the analysis of movement across time. In the sequence of generations, families create continuity and change with regard to parents and children; societies, with regard to economic resources, political power, and cultural hegemony. In all of these spheres generations are a basic unit of social reproduction and social change – in other words, of stability over time as well as renewal (or sometimes revolution).},

  abstract = {Students of the Enlightenment have long assumed that the major movement towards atheism in the Ancien Régime was centered in the circle of intellectuals who met at the home of Baron d'Holbach during the last half of the eighteenth century. This major critical study shows, contrary to the accepted views, that in fact, atheism was not the common bond of a majority of the members and that, far from being alienated figures, most of the members were privileged and publicly successful citizens devoted to peaceful and gradual reform. Alan Charles Kors determines the coterie's membership and discovers it to have been a diverse assemblage of philosophes, men of letters, and scientists. Analyzing the thought and behavior of those members who lived past 1789, the author argues that the hostility to the Revolution expressed by the coterie's survivors was fully consistent with their world view.Originally published in 1976.The Princeton Legacy Library uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press. These editions preserve the original texts of these important books while presenting them in durable paperback and hardcover editions. The goal of the Princeton Legacy Library is to vastly increase access to the rich scholarly heritage found in the thousands of books published by Princeton University Press since its founding in 1905.},

In 2014, fifty years later, an international congress was organized to try and highlight the contribution of this excavation to the knowledge of the history, philology and art history of the Ancient Near East. This book collects the papers from this international congress. Bringing together established and junior scholars from various areas, Ebla and Beyond aims at fostering the dialogue between experts in different fields of the history and archaeology of Syria in the Bronze and Iron Ages and between experienced foreign scholars and the latest generation of scholars of the School of Oriental Archaeology of Rome. The contributions in the book on the one hand show how much the discoveries at Ebla during forty-seven years of fieldwork have changed the way of understanding the developmental trajectory of Syria from the third through the first millennium BC. On the other hand, the work of the scholars from Rome and elsewhere proves how, even in difficult times for field archaeology, it is possible to exploit the results of a long-standing enterprise of this kind in a fruitful and sometimes revolutionary way},

  abstract = {Max Weber’s claim that traditional Chinese law was “khadi justice” continues to be a challenge facing scholars of Chinese legal history. While many scholars respond to this thesis at the level of empirical studies, their research cannot replace responses at the theoretical level. Thus, it is necessary to enter into a theoretical dialogue with Weber on the basis of empirical findings. Weber’s thought about China within the framework of his sociology of domination is a crucial factor influencing his presentation of Chinese law. In his original theoretical design, “patrimonial bureaucracy” is a mixed or in-between state of irrational and rational types of domination, since it contains elements of both patrimonialism and bureaucracy. Thus, justice and administration under such domination are not completely arbitrary. Weber’s assumption that world history increasingly moves toward full rationality, however, induces him to place China in the initial stage of the process of rationalization and to put the modern Western world at the end of that process. Under the influence of this thinking, Weber consciously or unconsciously neglects bureaucratic facets of imperial China’s patrimonial bureaucracy and deliberately amplifies its patrimonial facets. As a result, Chinese law in Weber’s writings is substantively irrational “khadi justice.” Although Weber’s concepts and insights are limited, if refined and revised they can still benefit future scholars of traditional Chinese law.},

He was director of the National Archives of France from 1913 to 1929. His 1897 work Introduction aux Etudes Historiques (Introduction to the Study of History), written with Charles Seignobos (1854-1942), is considered one of the first comprehensive manuals discussing the use of scientific techniques in historical research.

"This is not to say that machines think like people do and decide how they will act, but their behavior or nature often has a comparable role." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CHQ9WLD9?page=1}{Latour 1992:225})
\par
"It is the same with sociologists. They are constantly looking, somewhat desperately, for social links sturdy enough to tie all of us together or for moral laws that would be inflexible enough to make us behave properly. When adding up social ties, all does not balance. Soft humans and weak moralities are all sociologists can get. The society they try to recompose with bodies and norms constantly crumbles. Something is missing, something that should be strongly social and highly moral. Where can they find it? Everywhere, but they too often refuse to see it in spite of much new work in the sociology of artifacts. 2" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CHQ9WLD9?page=2}{Latour 1992:226})},

An authoritative account of its character, its development, its strengths and its weaknesses? Sometimes I am faced with this question. I am asked to speak for actor network theory. To tell about it. To offer a verdict. When this happens I feel uncomfortable. For the request poses a problem. The problem of what it is to be a “faithful representative”. And in particular with what it might mean to “represent” a theory that talks of representation in terms of translation. Which seeks to undermine the very idea that there might be such a thing as fidelity. Faithful translation. Which stresses that all representation also betrays its object. Perhaps there is no good answer. Or perhaps, there are many. But here is one possibility. That one might represent actor network theory by performing it rather than summarising it. By exploring a small number of case studies rather than seeking to uncover its “fundamental rules”. By telling of examples that are both faithful and unfaithful. By stressing that traduction is also trahison.},

Since Weber's account of the importance of this organizational mode to the functioning of contemporary socioeconomic systems, the inescapability of bureaucracy has been repeatedly theorized to show its good and ill effects. Yet anthropologists retain an ambivalent relation to this topic and can struggle to move beyond critique. I consider this ambivalence, suggesting that it reflects a frustrated desire for better governance, and offer neglected topics as potentially productive ways to tackle bureaucracy as an omnipresent yet difficult-to-pinpoint cultural form. Finally, the review makes the case for an impenitently anthropological approach to the fullness of bureaucracy, including testing the ethnographer's founding categories of thought, over a position of pure denunciation or evaluation.},

These roles and relations have four specific logical properties: reciprocity, transitivity, boundedness, and imaginary spatial dimensionality. These properties allow individuals to use them in communication to create ongoing, agreed-upon, organizations.

  abstract = {A researcher’s “pipeline” refers to the progression of papers from the idea stage to the publication stage. Tenure-track faculty and graduate students often are advised that a busy pipeline is the way to tenure. However, beyond the simple encouragement to “work harder,” “write more,” and “publish more,” not much direction is given to junior scholars regarding how they should think about and manage their research pipeline. How does one develop a large number of papers from their first stages to the pages of respected journals? This article discusses the author’s system for pipeline management. The system works (1) by separating the difficult exercise of publishing a paper into eight manageable stages; and (2) by organizing a set of papers using these steps according to a practicable timeline.},

Leave space on the right side of the board for two columns of numbers and dates that will track your overall progress. About three quarters of the left side should be arranged in a grid pattern so that each project can be listed in a separate square. For example, if you think that you will need 10 publications for tenure, leave room for 14 slots in the grid. The goal is to have all of the slots fi lled by the end of Year 3, listing each project that you expect will lead to publication."

To effectively organize their banditry, pirates required mechanisms to prevent internal predation, minimize crew conflict, and maximize piratical profit. Pirates devised two institutions for this purpose. First, I analyze the system of piratical checks and balances crews used to constrain captain predation. Second, I examine how pirates used democratic constitutions to minimize conflict and create piratical law and order. Pirate governance created sufficient order and cooperation to make pirates one of the most sophisticated and successful criminal organizations in history.}

Lewis and historian Kären Wigen reexamine the basic geographical divisions we take for granted, and challenge the unconscious spatial frameworks that govern the way we perceive the world. Arguing that notions of East vs. West, First World vs. Third World, and even the sevenfold continental system are simplistic and misconceived, the authors trace the history of such misconceptions. Their up-to-the-minute study reflects both on the global scale and its relation to the specific continents of Europe, Asia, and Africa—actually part of one contiguous landmass.The Myth of Continents sheds new light on how our metageographical assumptions grew out of cultural concepts: how the first continental divisions developed from classical times; how the Urals became the division between the so-called continents of Europe and Asia; how countries like Pakistan and Afghanistan recently shifted macroregions in the general consciousness.This extremely readable and thought-provoking analysis also explores the ways that new economic regions, the end of the cold war, and the proliferation of communication technologies change our understanding of the world. It stimulates thinking about the role of large-scale spatial constructs as driving forces behind particular worldviews and encourages everyone to take a more thoughtful, geographically informed approach to the task of describing and interpreting the human diversity of the planet.},

His "embeddedness" thesis, which holds that all economic activities and institutions are enmeshed in social relations and institutions, offers a sound theoretical basis for economic sociology. Nonetheless, he fails to embed the market concept. This theoretical lacuna manifests itself in his classic account of the rise of market society in England, The Great Transformation ([1944] 1957), where he neglects to consider institutional diversity and discontinuities in English commercial development. Polanyi's embeddedness thesis can be taken to its logical conclusion; that is, even the market can be embedded. "Markets" can be treated as social networks or organizations constituted by traders. I offer as an empirical illustration a brief case study of the rise of "market society" in England.},

In The Book of Circles, his companion volume to the popular Book of Trees, Manuel Lima takes us on a lively tour through millenia of information design. Three hundred detailed and colorful illustrations cover an encyclopedic array of subjects, drawing fascinating parallels across time and culture. The clay tokens used by ancient Sumerians as a system of recording trade are juxtaposed with the logos of modern retailers like Target; Venn diagrams are discussed side by side with symbols of the Christian trinity, the trefoil shape of the biohazard symbol, and the Olympic rings; a diagram revealing the characteristics of 10,000 porn stars displays structural similarities to early celestial charts placing the earth at the center of the universe. Lima's introduction provides an authoritative description of the circle's symbolism and uses through history, and a preface describes his unique taxomony of the many varieties of circle diagrams, rounding out this visual feast for infographics enthusiasts"--},

The fields represented are housekeeping, kitchen work (including food accounting), gatekeeping, and childcare. Except for nannies, most of these occupations have a male counterpart. Among the different types of sources, the ration lists provide a hierarchy of occupations and within occupations.},

How did our media-making forebears balance the tension between the present and the absent, the individual and the collective, the static and the dynamic—and how do our current digital networks disrupt these same balances? Can our social media, with its fleeting nature, even be considered social at all?  In Friending the Past, Alan Liu proposes fresh answers to these innovative questions of connection. He explores how we can learn from the relationship between past societies whose media forms fostered a communal and self-aware sense of history—such as prehistorical oral societies with robust storytelling cultures, or the great print works of nineteenth-century historicism—and our own instantaneous present. He concludes with a surprising look at how the sense of history exemplified in today’s JavaScript timelines compares to the temporality found in Romantic poetry. Interlaced among these inquiries, Liu shows how extensive “network archaeologies” can be constructed as novel ways of thinking about our affiliations with time and with each other. These conceptual architectures of period and age are also always media structures, scaffolded with the outlines of what we mean by history. Thinking about our own time, Liu wonders if the digital, networked future can sustain a similar sense of history.},

  abstract = {A measure of complexity for the macroscopic states of physical systems is defined. Called depth, the measure is universal: it applies to all physical systems. The form of the measure is uniquely fixed by the requirement that it be a continuous, additive function of the processes that can result in a state. Applied to a Hamiltonian system, the measure is equal to the difference between the system's coarse- and fine-grained entropy, a quantity that we call thermodynamic depth. The measure satisfies the intuitive requirements that wholly ordered and wholly random systems are not thermodynamically deep and that a complex object together with a copy is not much deeper than the object alone. Applied to systems capable of computation, the measure yields a conventional computational measure of complexity as a special case. The relation of depth and thermodynamic depth to previously proposed definitions of complexity is discussed, and applications to physical, chemical, and mathematical problems are proposed.},

The book offers a wide range of concepts and theorems that can be applied to politics and the economy, religion and science, art and education, organization and the family. Moreover, Luhmann's ideas address important contemporary issues in such diverse fields as cognitive science, ecology, and the study of social movements.This book provides all the necessary resources for readers to work through the foundations of systems theory - no other work by Luhmann is as clear and accessible as this. There is also much here that will be of great interest to more advanced scholars and practitioners in sociology and the social sciences},

The authors conclude that structuration theory is a more focused, informative, integrative, yet efficient, way to analyse how accounting systems are implicated in the construction, maintenance, and changes of the social order of an organization, than many frameworks used in previous studies. This article also speculates that Giddens' structuration theory with its key concepts of “structuration” and the “duality of structure” can be read along with Foucault's “power/knowledge” and Derrida's “deconstruction” as a post-modern genre for critical accounting research.},

  abstract = {Sociologists often model social processes as interactions among variables. We review an alternative approach that models social life as interactions among adaptive agents who influence one another in response to the influence they receive. These agent-based models (ABMs) show how simple and predictable local interactions can generate familiar but enigmatic global patterns, such as the diffusion of information, emergence of norms, coordination of conventions, or participation in collective action. Emergent social patterns can also appear unexpectedly and then just as dramatically transform or disappear, as happens in revolutions, market crashes, fads, and feeding frenzies. ABMs provide theoretical leverage where the global patterns of interest are more than the aggregation of individual attributes, but at the same time, the emergent pattern cannot be understood without a bottom up dynamical model of the microfoundations at the relational level. We begin with a brief historical sketch of the shift from "factors" to "actors" in computational sociology that shows how agent-based modeling differs fundamentally from earlier sociological uses of computer simulation. We then review recent contributions focused on the emergence of social structure and social order out of local interaction. Although sociology has lagged behind other social sciences in appreciating this new methodology, a distinctive sociological contribution is evident in the papers we review. First, theoretical interest focuses on dynamic social networks that shape and are shaped by agent interaction. Second, ABMs are used to perform virtual experiments that test macrosociological theories by manipulating structural factors like network topology, social stratification, or spatial mobility. We conclude our review with a series of recommendations for realizing the rich sociological potential of this approach.},

  abstract = {Cylinder seal impressions occur in many contexts in the ancient Near East. This disssertation focuses specifically on the function of sealing in the manipulation of state resources (land, labor, and goods) in second millennium B.C. Syria. The sources of information utilized in this study include textual references to sealing practices, sealed documents, bullae, and the seals themselves. The archives of Mari, Alalah, and Ugarit are particularly important as they provide textual and archaeological information on seals and sealing within the physical and institutional context of the palace, the center of state administration. Chapter 1 surveys the previous research on seals and sealing and briefly outlines Syrian geography and political history in the second millennium B.C. Chapter 2 examines the physical qualities of the seals--materials, methods of production, distribution and style. Chapter 3 addresses the problem of the physical and institutional context of seal use. A functional division between legal and administrative texts is reflected in the use of seals on them. On both types of documents, however, the use of a seal acknowledges the obligation of the sealer. The nature of that obligation varies with the contents of the text itself. Chapter 4 evaluates the use of seals on legal texts in palace archives. Most of these sealed documents record land grants. The historical trend in second millennium Syria is to an increasing involvement of heads-of-state in granting state land. Other sealed legal documents were kept in palace archives because the participants were in some way associated with the palace. Chapter 5 details the administrative use of seals at Mari. Receipts and expenditures are the most common sealed documents. The use of seals on these texts signals the acceptance by the sealer of responsibility for the goods or actions described therein. The conclusions (Chapter 6) summarize the differences in sealing practices in Mari, Alalah and Ugarit in light of the different historical circumstances and political needs of each state.},

  abstract = {The theory of nonlinear, complex systems has become by now a proven problem-solving approach in the natural sciences. And it is now also recognized that many if not most of our social, ecological, economical and political problems are essentially of a global, complex and nonlinear nature. And it is now further accepted than any holistic perspective of the human mind and brain can hardly be achieved by any other approach. In this wide-ranging, scholarly but very concise treatment, physicist, computer scientist and philosopher Klaus Mainzer discusses, in essentially nontechnical language, the common framework behind these ideas and challenges. Emphasis is given to the evolution of new structures in natural and cultural systems and we are lead to see clearly how the new integrative approach can give insights not available from traditional reductionistic methods. The fifth edition enlarges and revises almost all sections and supplements an entirely new chapter on the complexity of economic systems. From the reviews of the fourth edition:  "This book is ambitious, incredibly erudite with 22 pages of references, and is indisputably clearly and beautifully written and illustrated. It is perfectly suited to a first course on the science of complexity. Even beginners and young graduate students will have something to learn from this book." (Andre Hautot, Physicalia, Vol. 57 (3), 2005)  "All-in-all, this highly recommended book is a wonderful resource for intuitive basic ideas in the need of rigorous formulation." (Albert A. Mullin, Zentralblatt MATH, vol. 1046, 2004) "Readers of this book will enjoy Mainzer's exposition, which is based on a tight coupling between classical and historical concepts from Plato and Aristotle to modern, mathematical and physical developments . Every chapter begins with a section designed to orient the reader to the perspective of philosophical developments through the ages pertinent to the topic at hand. The author takes pains to point out essential differences between classical science and the science of complexity. Thinking in Complexity is an outstandingly readable book."

In the last few years, discoveries of new texts and archaeological materials from the Sealand Dynasty have emerged, which expand the possibilities to fill this gap in our knowledge of Mesopotamian history. At the same time, scholars have started to revive Kassite studies using new materials, methods, and questions. While those works are groundbreaking contributions to the field, many questions about the history and chronology, archaeology, economy, language of Babylonia during this period are still unsolved. This volume brings together eleven contributions by leading scholars in the Sealand and Kassite period, approaching those questions from an archaeological, ethnological, historical, linguistic, and economical point of view.

  abstract = {This article examines the relationship between social boundaries, territoriality and ancestor veneration during the Late Intermediate Period (1000–1450 AD) in the Rapayán Valley of the Central Andes of Peru. Constructing upon recent theoretical work on social boundaries and territoriality combined with the analyses of early historical sources, I argue that the distribution of various types of above-ground mortuary structures across the landscape was a powerful mechanism of social control through space that not only served to assess territorial rights, but also to confine or exclude people from a bounded space by the delimitation of social boundaries. I sustain that above-ground mortuary structures reflected a growing concern for territorial behaviors during the LIP that allowed household members, kinship groups and/or political units, according to varying contexts, to draw social boundaries between insiders and outsiders by reifying identity and social solidarity through ancestors worship. Within the broader Andean context, I suggest that the widespread distribution of mortuary monuments across the landscape provided the political landscape with an ideology of fragmentation which encouraged the distinction between insiders and outsiders and thus promoted group identity through social exclusion from a geographical point of view at many different levels.},

  abstract = {The dilemma Erklären -- Verstehen cannot be resolved either by simply rejecting one of the alternative methods, or by relegating them to two different fields of application (sciences versus history and philosophy). Explanation and understanding are two opposite but complementary dimensions of social inquiry. The emphasis on one or the other will depend (1) on the degree of reification of a particular social situation to be studied, and (2) on the extent to which we need an objective, validated account of the situation. A social situation is reified if its actors acquire, or are a scribed, the characteristics of things. The concept of reification is applied to three different levels: (i) objects (human behaviour under certain historical conditions actually obtains thinglike properties: work becomes repetitive, political life formalistic, society is ruled by alienated social forces); (ii) theory about objects (in the search for objective knowledge individual, subjective features of human behaviour must be left aside); (iii) meta-theory (when critical consciousness about the limits of our objective methodology is absent and when our intellectual instruments become too frozen and hardened). The greater the degree of reification in the field of our study, the more adequate will be the methods of external observation and theoretical explanation analogous with those in natural sciences. No matter how strongly motivated isolated individuals might be, unpredictable interactions among them (in a poorly organised society) acquire the character of chance events. Central statistical tendencies of these appear as blind forces that prevail over individual human wills. Therefore understanding of individual motives and aspirations plays a minor cognitive role under these conditions. However, in those fields of social activity where individual values and goals are permanently relevant (eg. culture) or in those phases of history where conscious collective coordination becomes decisive (eg. in epochs of social change) the study of overt behaviour does not suffice and must be supplemented by the study of human needs, drives and intentions. Furthermore, while the method of understanding is considerably inferior from the point of view of intersubjective reliability and validity of its result there are situations in which we either do not need or cannot have objective knowledge, and in which precisely individual and group understanding is indispensable (ie. when we have to act quickly, when the personnel and funds for objective scientific investigation are lacking and when we are primarily interested in free, spontaneous individual- or group-behaviour). It is misleading to construe methods of explanation and understanding as two polar opposites (the former being purely objective, the later simply subjective). On the one hand, the choice of problems to be investigated, the selection and interpretation of data, the direction of analysis and theory building will inevitably be influenced by the scholar's scale of value and various extra-scientific considerations. On the other hand, the process of internalisation of observed data need not be purely subjective (in so far as there might be a high degree of correlation among introspective statements of various individuals). Also the statements that serve to connect two subjective states (eg. thought and a goal) may be well supported by the theoretical findings of psychology. In this case the method of understanding coincides with a specific (motivational) type of the method of explanation. At the end the author shows how Erklären and Verstehen may be reinterpreted as two special moments within dialectic, conceived as a method of critical social study characterised by both structural and historical, objective and subjective approach.},

After incorporation of this individual-level process within the framework of Coleman's model, its effects at the system level are explored by comparing results generated by the modified model with those produced by the original model. Analyses of artificial data indicate that the nature and magnitude of system-level effects are contingent on (1) the pattern of interest differentiation in the influence network; and (2) the degree of centralization of the influence network. Depending on these features, the effects of the influence process on collective decision making may be (1) a decline in the system level of resource mobilization; (2) an increase in the level of apparent consensus on collective decisions; and/or (3) a bias in collective decisions toward the interests of the actors centrally located in the influence network.},

But, as collectives grow, the open boundaries that enable the mobilization of participants and rapid exchange of ideas can give rise to new organizing challenges that make collective action untenable. We examine this tension by exploring how networked activists self-organize through open, digital networks to achieve shared aims without belonging to a common organization that supports their cause. With a seven-year, inductive field and archival study, we capture how activists from the Anonymous collective organized 70 protest actions while struggling to integrate newcomers and coordinate increasingly complex activities. Rather than succumb to chaos or managerial control, Anonymous learned to self-organize, gradually abandoning normative forms of control in favor of forms of architectural control. By creating a participation architecture—a sociotechnical framework that empowered technical experts and unobtrusively channeled newcomers to designated forums—networked activists enhanced their collective ability to coordinate complex, interdependent actions at scale. Our grounded theoretical model reveals how the challenges of self-organizing emerge with rapid growth and how these can be overcome by configuring architectural control.},

A Problem of Historiographic Philology In this critical essay, results of an investigation into the published and unpublished manuscripts of Marc Bloch 's Historian's Craft are provided. The collection and study of direct and indirect testimony concerning this work demonstrate that the unfinished text raises certain problems. Posthumously published in 1949 by L. Febvre, it is not an exact translation of the text written by Bloch. While it is possible to distinguish two different phases of the writing, the text published by Febvre concerns only the latest of the two. The specifically philological problemsposed by the Historian's Craft are, at the same time, historiographic and philosophical ones.},

This paper presents a novel method for generating such datasets, along with several examples. Our technique varies from previous approaches in that new datasets are iteratively generated from a seed dataset through random perturbations of individual data points, and can be directed towards a desired outcome through a simulated annealing optimization strategy. Our method has the benefit of being agnostic to the particular statistical properties that are to remain constant between the datasets, and allows for control over the graphical appearance of resulting output.},

  abstract = {Our civilization is rooted in the forms and innovations of societies that flourished more than six thousand years ago in distant lands of western Asia, extending from Egypt to India. The earliest of these societies was in the region known to the ancients as Mesopotamia, which occupies what is today Iraq, northeastern Syria, and southeastern Turkey. In Mesopotamia arose the first cities, and here urban institutions were invented and evolved. Writing was invented, monumental architecture in the form of temples and palaces were created, and the visual arts flowered in the service of religion and royalty. These extraordinary innovations profoundly affected surrounding areas in Anatolia, Syria-Levant, Iran, and the Gulf. Mesopotamia was influenced in turn by these outlying regions, for as networks of trade emerged they encouraged cultural exchange. This publication explores the artistic achievements of the era of the first cities in both the Mesopotamian heartland and across the expanse of western Asia. More than fifty experts in the field have contributed entries on individual works of art and essays covering a wide range of subjects. Among the objects presented are many that display the pure style of Mesopotamia, others from outlying regions that adapt from Mesopotamian models a corpus of forms and images, and still others that embody vital regional styles. Included are reliefs celebrating the accomplishments of kings and the pastimes of the elite; votive statues representing royal and other privileged persons; animal sculptures; and spectacular jewelry, musical instruments, and games found in tombs where kings, queens, and their servants were buried. -- Metropolitan Museum of Art website.},

These nearly intact images are masterpieces of the miniature art of the very end of Early Dynastic IIIB, and probably belonged to a precious ceremonial standard of an Ebla queen. The proposal is that the standard represented the homage paid by queen Tabur-Damu, the last Ebla king Ishar-Damu's wife, to a funerary statue of the deceased queen mother Dusigu.},

  abstract = {The study of the semiotics of palaces in the Ancient Near East and Ancient Egypt provides the historian with diverse information as size and type of architecture demonstrate the kind of representation chosen by rulers towards their world. Some features were adopted from temples in order to stage the appearance of the ruler like a divine epiphany. Some further integrate a temple within the palace, showcasing the desire of the ruler to live with a specific deity under one roof for divine support and protection. The importance of this ruler can also be reflected by the size of the throne room and the number of columns, showing as well a hierarchy in the use of space within the whole building complex and its different units. For instance, the presence of a rather intimate throne room or a second small throne room points to space for confidential exchange between the ruler and his visitors. The capacity of storerooms additionally gives us insight into the economic power standing behind the palace. The comparison of different elements between palatial and domestic architecture also proves helpful in identifying the origins of particular components.0Exploration of such semiotics was initiated with the publication of the first palace volume in 2018 (Verlag der ÖAW, Vienna) following a conference held in London 2013. The present volume stands in direct continuation and is the result of a second palace conference that took place at the 10th ICAANE 2016 in Vienna. Besides introducing other palaces in Egypt and Nubia, this volume is dedicated primarily to Near Eastern palaces which are presented and studied by prominent experts in this field},

Ebla grew from a small Early Bronze Age settlement into an important trading and political centre, which endured until its final destruction in c.1600 BC. The destruction of its royal palace c.2300 BC was particularly significant as it preserved the city's rich archives, offering a wealth of information on its history, economy, religion, administration and daily life. The discovery of Ebla is a pivotal moment in the history of archaeological investigations of the 20th century, and this book is the result of all the excavation campaigns at Tell Mardikh-Ebla from 1964 until 2010, when field operations stopped for the war in Syria. Available for the first time in English, Ebla offers a complete account of one of the largest pre-classical urban centres by its discoverer, making it an essential resource for students of Ancient Near Eastern archaeology and history"--},

  abstract = {One of the most significant transformations in the emergence of economically and socially complex societies has been the development of social groups with differential access to productive resources. Anthropologists have puzzled over the number of empirical cases suggesting that women have disproportionately lost access to productive resources. This paper follows one such case—the development of textile workshops in Mesopotamia—to offer new insights into the alienation of women producers in the ancient Near East and the development of Mesopotamia's political economies. During the transformation from a series of relatively self‐sufficient communities to a highly integrated complex of rural and urban settlements, a fundamental shift took place from the use of flax to the use of wool for the majority of textile production. This shift has extremely important implications for archaeologists' reconstructions of agricultural production, labor roles, and social relationships. This paper explores the socioeconomic context of a change in the materials of textile production and its potential for explaining the development of important aspects of social complexity and political economy in ancient Mesopotamia.},

So far the dominant model has been, and continues to be, that of the homo economicus, although with certain variants. Homo economicus, in simple terms, is an individual with interests and preferences and a rational capacity oriented to maximizing those preferences, which are usually considered as self-regarding.This model has its immediate source in John Stuart Mill, with antecedents in certain nineteenth-century economists, ultimately traceable to Adam Smith, who had a broader view of the human being. Originally, homo economicus was conceived of not as an accurate description of human nature but as a model of economic behavior; however, in time, it became a crucial element of the neoclassical scheme of price equilibrium, and even the “only way” of understanding economic and organizational behavior.In recent decades, the homo economicus model has been the object of severe criticism from many sides, since it is highly reductionist and manifests important shortcomings as a concept of the human being.},

Organizations whose structures become isomorphic with the myths of the institutional environment-in contrast with those primarily structured by the demands of technical production and exchange-decrease internal coordination and control in order to maintain legitimacy. Structures are decoupled from each other and from ongoing activities. In place of coordination, inspection, and evaluation, a logic of confidence and good faith is employed.}

This book collects the papers from this international congress. Bringing together established and junior scholars from various areas, Ebla and Beyond aims at fostering the dialogue between experts in different fields of the history and archaeology of Syria in the Bronze and Iron Ages and between experienced foreign scholars and the latest generation of scholars of the School of Oriental Archaeology of Rome. The contributions in the book on the one hand show how much the discoveries at Ebla during forty-seven years of fieldwork have changed the way of understanding the developmental trajectory of Syria from the third through the first millennium BC. On the other hand, the work of the scholars from Rome and elsewhere proves how, even in difficult times for field archaeology, it is possible to exploit the results of a long-standing enterprise of this kind in a fruitful and sometimes revolutionary way},

  abstract = {The discovery of large numbers of cuneiform texts at the Syrian site of Tell Mardikh, which turned out to be the ancient city of Ebla, created a sensation in scholarly circles as well as among the public at large. Soon after the discovery synthetic accounts of the culture of ancient Ebla, as well as scholarly publications of the tablets uncovered in that city, began to appear. Although some time has passed since the initial opinions on the social and political organization of Ebla were expressed, many of the first impressions of scholars working on these materials have not been supported by the evidence which has been available. In this study I reexamine some of these assumptions in light of the published documentation, concentrating on the chronology of the archives and on the relationships with the city-state of Mari.},

The authors represent a highly international mix of leading academics whose expertise brings alive the people, places and times of the remote past. The emphasis lies firmly on the political and social histories of the states and communities under investigation. The individual chapters present the key textual and material sources underpinning the historical reconstruction, giving special attention to the most recent archaeological finds and how they have impacted our interpretation. The first volume covers the long period from the mid-tenth millennium to the late third millennium BC and presents the history of the Near East in ten chapters "From the Beginnings to Old Kingdom Egypt and the Dynasty of Akkad". Key topics include the domestication of animals and plants, the first permanent settlements, the subjugation and appropriation of the natural environment, the emergence of complex states and belief systems, the invention of the earliest writing systems and the wide-ranging trade networks that linked diverse population groups across deserts, mountains and oceans"--},

  abstract = {This book focuses on the ancient Near East, early imperial China, South-East Asia, and medieval Europe, shedding light on mathematical knowledge and practices documented by sources relating to the administrative and economic activities of officials, merchants and other actors. It compares these to mathematical texts produced in related school contexts or reflecting the pursuit of mathematics for its own sake to reveal the diversity of mathematical practices in each of these geographical areas of the ancient world. Based on case studies from various periods and political, economic and social contexts, it explores how, in each part of the world discussed, it is possible to identify and describe the different cultures of quantification and computation as well as their points of contact. The thirteen chapters draw on a wide variety of texts from ancient Near East, China, South-East Asia and medieval Europe, which are analyzed by researchers from various fields, including mathematics, history, philology, archaeology and economics. The book will appeal to historians of science, economists and institutional historians of the ancient and medieval world, and also to Assyriologists, Indologists, Sinologists and experts on medieval Europe.},

A substantial introductory essay surveys the historiography and theoretical development of the history of cartography and situates the work of the multi-volume series within this scholarly tradition. Cartographic themes include an emphasis on the spatial-cognitive abilities of Europe’s prehistoric peoples and their transmission of cartographic concepts through media such as rock art; the emphasis on mensuration, land surveys, and architectural plans in the cartography of Ancient Egypt and the Near East; the emergence of both theoretical and practical cartographic knowledge in the Greco-Roman world; and the parallel existence of diverse mapping traditions (mappaemundi, portolan charts, local and regional cartography) in the Medieval period.Throughout the volume, a commitment to include cosmographical and celestial maps underscores the inclusive definition of "map" and sets the tone for the breadth of scholarship found in later volumes of the series.},

Polanyi provides counterbalancing emphases for each of these orientations in his explanation of skillful performance. The latter portion of this study draws conclusions about the perspectives of Simon and Polanyi and identifies implications for research on rationality and knowledge management.},

They garner information from keyword searches, carried out across millions of documents, their research shaped by algorithms they rarely understand. Historians often then visit archives in whirlwind trips marked by thousands of digital photographs, subsequently explored on computer monitors from the comfort of their offices. They may then take to social media or other digital platforms, their work shaped through these new forms of pre- and post-publication review. Almost all aspects of the historian's research workflow have been transformed by digital technology. In other words, all historians – not just Digital Historians – are implicated in this shift. The Transformation of Historical Research in the Digital Age equips historians to be self-conscious practitioners by making these shifts explicit and exploring their long-term impact.

Watts, Six Degrees: The Science of a Connected Age, Gardner's Books, New York, 2003]. Commonalities among complex biological networks, e.g., immune systems, social insects, and cellular metabolism, and their relation to intelligence in computational systems are explored in the proceedings of a interdisciplinary conference on “Distributed Autonomous Systems” [L.A. Segel, I.R. Cohen (Eds.), Design Principles for the Immune System and Other Distributed Autonomous Systems, Oxford University Press, New York, 2001]. The ideas discussed in the third book have led to me to propose four general principles of adaptive information processing in decentralized systems. These principles, and the relevance of “network thinking” for artificial intelligence (and vice versa), are the subject of the last two sections of the article.},

Indeed, this piece served as the opening chapter to his Introduzione bibliografica alla storia greca fino a Socrate (Florence: La Nuova Italia, 1975), and its subsequent reprints as an independent essay in several Italian journals and anthologies signal its importance for Momigliano. In this provocative and occasionally brilliantly witty essay, Momigliano sets forth his programmatic views on the ethos of the historian, as well as on the historical method and its applications in the study of ancient history. Here, as elsewhere, Momigliano is interested in detailing the link between ancient documents and their historical interpretations in later millennia. Ancient sources, he cautions, do not capture ancient realities transparently or completely, but are mediated documents whose historical value hinges, within certain limits, on the historian's analytical questions, inflected as they inevitably are by different ideological commitments. For this reason, he places special emphasis on the comparative method, stressing difference rather than similarity, and advises that historians with various areas of expertise collaborate, a point underscored throughout the essay. What is more, the essay contains the salutary reminder that the historian ought to attend not only to the surviving documents but also to the conspicuous silences and lacunae in the evidence.},

Weber's many interests in and contributions to, such diverse fields as epistemology, political sociology, the sociology of religion and economic history are compared with and connected to those of his friends, pupils and antagonists and also of those contemporaries with whom he had neither a personal relationship nor any kind of scholoarly exchange.},

Here, research on social cohesion and social embeddedness is linked by developing a concept of structural cohesion based on network node connectivity. Structural cohesion is defined as the minimum number of actors who, if removed from a group, would disconnect the group. A structural dimension of embeddedness can then be defined through the hierarchical nesting of these cohesive structures. The empirical applicability of nestedness is demonstrated in two dramatically different substantive settings, and additional theoretical implications with reference to a wide array of substantive fields are discussed.},

  abstract = {Economics revolves around a central character: “economic man.” As historians, we are all familiar with various episodes in the history of this character, and we appreciate his ever-changing aspect even while many of our colleagues in economics think the rational economic agent of neoclassical economics is the same kind of person as Adam Smith's economic man. The fact that this is a familiar history means that I can focus on a few salient examples—a “short” history, rather than a complete history— to provide the raw material for my account which has a more specific agenda than simply a history of economic man. My aim is to re-consider the history of economic man as a model man. This leads to two further questions: What kind of a role has this model man played in relation to the science he inhabits? And, how can we characterize the processes by which economists have arrived at their model characters?To illuminate this history of economic man, I adopt ideas from philosophy about how scientists arrive at models and use them in science. Of course, economists have always had their own ideas about such matters. So in effect, there are two intersecting strands in this account: one is how economists have discussed their strategies in creating these characters, and the other is how philosophers of science have—at the time and since—labeled and thought about such strategies. These discussions, from the economists and from philosophers, will enable us to explore the usefulness of the concept of idealization, a standard way of thinking about model construction in philosophy of science. They will also allow us to consider model man as an ideal type (using Weber's concept) or as a caricature (to follow Gibbard and Varian's label). These analytical labels—ideal types, idealization, and so forth—relate to questions about the status of models and their construction that are sometimes evident, and sometimes lie below the surface, but always remain important in the historical discussions about economics as a science. My account is concerned then with constructions of the persona of economic man, how he has changed over the last 250 years, how far we can regard that character as a model, and with reflections on his role in the changing science of economics.},

  abstract = {The ephemeral nature of computer-enabled historical work is a well-documented concern within the field of history. The quick pace of technological change often renders digital scholarship obsolete, which in turn encourages historians to retreat to the stable and durable comfort of print, even as digital methodologies enrich our research and expand the audience for it. What has been missing so far in the conversation about digital history is a clear understanding of how it differs from traditional historical products, what can be gained from it, and how we might document the work undertaken using these machine-based methodologies. Because it is best understood as a process rather than as a product, digital history must have a history of its own to tether it to the scholarly community and to ensure that it endures past the active phase of any project. This article argues that digital historians should catalog their work using a normalized template following the Digital Documentation Process, a guide for producing documentation that is suitable for computer-based historical scholarship and tailored to its specific parameters. Self-documentation is beneficial to those who create digital history and those who consume it. It is urgent to establish a field-wide expectation that digital history will be consistently documented as a matter of course, lest we lose scholarship that has already been produced and forgo the enormous opportunities that computer-enabled methodologies offer to historians.},

  abstract = {Language is highly dynamic: It unfolds over time, and we can use it to achieve a wide variety of communicative goals, from telling a story to trying to persuade another person. One aspect of language that has gained increasing popularity among researchers in the last several decades is the individual language style (LS) represented by an individual’s use of function words (e.g., pronouns, articles). Previous approaches to LS mostly focus on LS of one individual in isolation, paying less attention to the fact that language emerges from interaction with others. The aim of this paper is twofold: First, we integrate LS into a dynamical theoretical framework and present an innovative methodological approach. Second, this paper aims to address how interactive conversation—as an aspect of the communicative setting—changes an individual’s LS. We use recurrence quantification analysis to look at structure in patterns of LS in monologs and conversations of 118 participants. Our results showed that LS significantly differs from monolog to conversation, and post hoc analyses further revealed that the change in LS is greater for conflict than for friendly conversations. The difference between monologs and conversations is reflected more strongly in the dynamics (i.e., structure and complexity) of LS than the proportion of function words used. Theoretical implications and directions for future studies are discussed.},

  abstract = {Archaeology, Artifacts and Antiquities of the Ancient Near East follows the evolution of the author’s scholarly work and interests and is divided into several categories of interrelated fields. The first part deals primarily with excavations and associated artifacts, issues in ancient geography and the identification of ancient sites in northwest Iran, the author’s research involving the culture and chronology of the Phrygian capital at Gordion in Anatolia, and the chronology and Iranian cultural relations of a site in the Emirate of Sharjah. Part two is wide-ranging and includes chapters on Aegean and ancient Near Eastern cultural and political interconnections, the role of fibulae in revealing cultural and chronological matters, and the gender-determined usage of parasols and their recognition in excavated contexts. There are also articles specifically concerned with “Plunder Culture” and the forgery of both objects and their alleged proveniences. Át 1,088 pages, this volume provides a wonderful sample– chosen by Muscarella himself – of forty papers spanning the author’s career and many interests...This volume is so rich that it contains something for everyone.D́.T.

In 2014, fifty years later, an international congress was organized to try and highlight the contribution of this excavation to the knowledge of the history, philology and art history of the Ancient Near East. This book collects the papers from this international congress. Bringing together established and junior scholars from various areas, Ebla and Beyond aims at fostering the dialogue between experts in different fields of the history and archaeology of Syria in the Bronze and Iron Ages and between experienced foreign scholars and the latest generation of scholars of the School of Oriental Archaeology of Rome. The contributions in the book on the one hand show how much the discoveries at Ebla during forty-seven years of fieldwork have changed the way of understanding the developmental trajectory of Syria from the third through the first millennium BC. On the other hand, the work of the scholars from Rome and elsewhere proves how, even in difficult times for field archaeology, it is possible to exploit the results of a long-standing enterprise of this kind in a fruitful and sometimes revolutionary way},

This paper reconsiders Weber's thought in the light of his two-decade-long preoccupation with the methodological and substantive issues raised by that debate. It presents Weber's culminating contribution, the 1909 edition of The Agrarian Sociology of Ancient Civilisations, as a resolution of 'Marx's paradox' as well as his most rounded attempt to overcome the tension between history and theory in accordance with the approach advocated in the methodological essays of 1903–1906.},

  abstract = {The scientific study of networks, including computer networks, social networks, and biological networks, has received an enormous amount of interest in the last few years. The rise of the Internet and the wide availability of inexpensive computers have made it possible to gather and analyze network data on a large scale, and the development of a variety of new theoretical tools has allowed us to extract new knowledge from many different kinds of networks. The study of networks is broadly interdisciplinary and important developments have occurred in many fields, including mathematics, physics, computer and information sciences, biology, and the social sciences. This book brings together for the first time the most important breakthroughs in each of these fields and presents them in a coherent fashion, highlighting the strong interconnections between work in different areas. Subjects covered include the measurement and structure of networks in many branches of science, methods for analyzing network data, including methods developed in physics, statistics, and sociology, the fundamentals of graph theory, computer algorithms, and spectral methods, mathematical models of networks, including random graph models and generative models, and theories of dynamical processes taking place on networks.},

  abstract = {A serious problem for covering law explanation is raised and its consequences for the Hempelian theory of explanation are discussed. The problem concerns an intensional feature of explanations, involving the manner in which theoretical law statements are related to the events explained. The basic problem arises because explanations are not of events but of events under descriptions; moreover, in a sense, our linguistic descriptions outrun laws. One form of the problem, termed the problem of weak intensionality, is apparently solved by a simple logical move, but in fact the problem arises in a new, strong form. It is found that Hempel's model for deductive explanation (to which this discussion is confined) requires modification to handle the weak intensionality problem but then is faced with the problem of strong intensionality. In consequence, it is suggested that Hempel's important concept of explanation sketch is not as widely applicable as usually claimed, especially for explanations in the behavioral and social sciences and history. Reason is found to reject the covering law thesis that every scientific explanation must contain at least one law statement. An important feature of the discussion is that some of the main reasons given for altering the deductive model and for considering other forms of explanation are internal to the covering law theory.},

  abstract = {Nebuchadnezzar I (r. 1125-1104) was one of the more significant and successful kings to rule Babylonia in the intervening period between the demise of the Kassite Dynasty in the 12th century at the end of the Late Bronze Age, and the emergence of a new, independent Babylonian monarchy in the last quarter of the 7th century. His dynamic reign saw Nebuchadnezzar active on both domestic and foreign fronts. He tended to the needs of the traditional cult sanctuaries and their associated priesthoods in the major cities throughout Babylonia and embarked on military campaigns against both Assyria in the north and Elam to the east. Yet later Babylonian tradition celebrated him for one achievement that was little noted in his own royal inscriptions: the return of the statue of Marduk, Babylon’s patron deity, from captivity in Elam.  The Reign of Nebuchadnezzar reconstructs the history of Nebuchadnezzar I’s rule and, drawing upon theoretical treatments of historical and collective memory, examines how stories of his reign were intentionally utilized by later generations of Babylonian scholars and priests to create an historical memory that projected their collective identity and reflected Marduk’s rise to the place of primacy within the Babylonian pantheon in the 1st millennium BCE. It also explores how this historical memory was employed by the urban elite in discourses of power. Nebuchadnezzar I remained a viable symbol, though with diminishing effect, until at least the 3rd century BCE, by which time his memory had almost entirely faded. This study is a valuable resource to students of the Ancient Near East and Nebuchadnezzar, but is also a fascinating exploration of memory creation and exploitation in the ancient world.},

  abstract = {From the ninth century until the last quarter of the seventh century BCE, the Assyrian Empire first extended its power over Babylonia and then engaged in a prolonged effort to retain control. The patchwork nature of Babylonian society—divided as it was between the traditional urban centers, territories controlled by five distinct Chaldean tribes, and regions inhabited by Aramaean tribes—presented opportunities and challenges for Assyria as it sought to assert its dominance. Assyrian interactions with the Chaldean tribes of Babylonia redefined the Chaldeans’ place within power relationships in southern Mesopotamia. Starting in 878, Assyria first perceived Chaldean territory as distinct from what they defined as Karduniaš, the land ruled by the king of Babylon. Shalmaneser III exploited and accentuated this division by recognizing the Chaldean leaders as kings and accepting their tribute even as he concluded a treaty with the Babylonian king, Marduk-zakir-shumi I. By decentralizing power in Babylonia, Assyria was able to assert indirect control over Babylonia. However, periods of Assyrian weakness created opportunities for several Chaldeans—drawing upon the economic and military power they could muster—to claim the title of king of Babylon with all the accompanying ideological power. These new developments prompted Assyria under the Sargonids to create counter-narratives that questioned the legitimacy of Chaldeans as kings of Babylon by presenting them as strange and inimical to the Assyrian order even as Assyrian interactions with the Chaldeans improved Assyrian familiarity with them.},

In 2014, fifty years later, an international congress was organized to try and highlight the contribution of this excavation to the knowledge of the history, philology and art history of the Ancient Near East. This book collects the papers from this international congress. Bringing together established and junior scholars from various areas, Ebla and Beyond aims at fostering the dialogue between experts in different fields of the history and archaeology of Syria in the Bronze and Iron Ages and between experienced foreign scholars and the latest generation of scholars of the School of Oriental Archaeology of Rome. The contributions in the book on the one hand show how much the discoveries at Ebla during forty-seven years of fieldwork have changed the way of understanding the developmental trajectory of Syria from the third through the first millennium BC. On the other hand, the work of the scholars from Rome and elsewhere proves how, even in difficult times for field archaeology, it is possible to exploit the results of a long-standing enterprise of this kind in a fruitful and sometimes revolutionary way},

  abstract = {This inquiry seeks to understand how the original form of writing in Mesopotamia—the small pictures and conventions of protocuneiform— became cuneiform, a script that could not be read without acquiring the neurological and behavioral reorganizations understood today as literacy. The process is described as involving small neurological and behavioral changes realized, accumulated, and distributed to new users through in- teractions with and concomitant incremental changes in the material form of writing. A related inquiry focuses on why and how numerical notations differ from other written signs. Crucially, numerical signs instantiate their meaning, a representational mode that contrasts with the signification used to represent non-numerical language and which makes numerical notations contiguous with their unwritten precursors, technologies like fingers, tallies, and counters. Instantiation is related to the perceptual system for quantity; this so-called number sense influences the function and form of numerical signs. Reading is then discussed as a cognitive activity that necessarily in- volves a material form, a plausible example of extended cognition. Because numerical notations share function and often form with precursor technolo- gies, if the former participate in extended cognition, the latter likely do as well. In conjunction with the contiguity between numerical notations and their unwritten precursors, this complicates the idea that (all) writing is (just) language. Finally, potential follow-on research is suggested.},

I begin by comparing and contrasting various definitions of complexity and then describe the attributes of systems capable of producing complexity: diversity, networked interactions, interdependent behavior, and adaptation. Next, I survey the contributions of complexity sciences with the most resonance with sociology. I organize those contributions into four categories: dynamics, aggregation, distributions, and functional properties of structure and diversity. On the basis of that survey, I conclude that incorporating complexity science into sociology requires the introduction of new models and methodologies as well as a more expansive approach to empirical research, and that the benefits of a deeper engagement with complexity will be substantial.},

Data on couples and their money are drawn from the Family Expenditure Survey, and from focus groups and interviews. The data were collected in the course of a study on new forms of money, such as credit and debit cards, telephone and Internet banking. The results suggest that the accounting practices of couples are not necessarily consistent, but that they are meaningful. They are not consistent in that different parts of the intra‐household economy are likely to be subject to different types and levels of accountability. They are meaningful in that accounting practices reflect the economic position of the household, the relative incomes of husband and wife and fundamental aspects of their relationship. Banking arrangements, as they record financial history and map past and present relationships, offer a powerful guide to understanding wider issues within marriage and family life.}

Despite this disciplinary impact and archaeological investigations at Kültepe and elsewhere, our understanding of this phenomenon has remained largely text-based and therefore of limited analytical scope, both spatially and contextually. This book re-assesses the Old-Assyrian trade network in Upper Mesopotamia and Central Anatolia during the Middle Bronze Age (c. 1970 - 1700 BC) by combining in some analytical detail the archaeology (e.g. material culture, settlement data, etc.) of the region both on its own terms and via a range of spatial approaches. The author offers a comparative and spatial perspective on exchange networks and economic strategies, continuity and discontinuity of specific trade circuits and routes, and the evolution of political landscapes throughout the Near East in the Middle Bronze Age},

  abstract = {Nurturing babies is an issue inextricably bound to all species in nature. In prehistoric times, breastfeeding was the first priority of mothers until later in infancy. In ancient times breastfeeding continued to be of crucial importance, and goddesses of motherhood are presented with naked breasts. Concurrently, for the first time in history, wet nurses appeared in societies as a legal profession to replace mothers when they were unable to feed their children; special utensils for artificial feeding appeared as well. In Ancient Egypt breastfeeding was first priority of mothers until infants reached six months of age and then, cow’s milk was given to children. In Ancient Mesopotamia and Ancient Greece, breastfeeding was of high value and one can find numerous references in mythology. Wet nursing was also widespread in these societies. Nevertheless, great historians and philosophers, such as Aristotle and Plutarch opposed to employing wet nurses, as they strongly believed that breastfeeding was a duty of the mother. In Roman times, wet nursing began to be a choice of the majority of wealthy families. In Israel and China, breastfeeding continued until the age of two years, while in Indies, it stopped at six months, when teething starts. In Islam, breastfeeding had a religious basis and usually lasted for two years and wet nurses were selected by parents with great thoughtfulness. In Byzantine times, the duration of breastfeeding was set at around twenty months. Colostrum was considered unsuitable and for the first days of life honey was given to newborns instead. In Middle Ages, objections against wet nursing reappeared as it was considered that breast milk could transmit physical and psychological characteristics of the woman and that breastfeeding was a maternal duty. In Renaissance, writings on pediatrics strongly argued mother’s breastfeeding. At the end of eighteenth century, new substitutes of feeding infants appeared such as animal milk, pap and panada. In the ensuing years (19 th century) mothers had to work in order to contribute to family income, and for the first time artificial feeding became the first choice. At the outset of this century, the first chemical analysis gave a vast advantage over human milk. Notwithstanding, in the twentieth century, formulas continued to be the first choice as advertising exerted its influence on public opinion. Especially in developed countries, there was a dramatic increase in the use of formulas, as it was considered to be the best nutrition for the infants. As a result, an outbreak of necrotizing enterocolitis occurred with increase in infant mortality. Mothers avoided breastfeeding as they often felt ashamed, as breast is an element of woman’s sexuality. Lately, a strong movement is noticed worldwide attempting to convince societies and healthcare professionals on the innumerable advantages of breastfeeding for the mother, the infants and in the long-term for the health systems.}

This field has, in spite of its central importance, been in a notably undeveloped stae. The emergence of a highly generalized conceptual scheme in social theory which has elsewhere been traced by the author suggests the possibility of a more thorough theoretical approach than has hitherto been possible. Social stratification, here regarded as the differential ranking of the human individuals who compose a given social system and their treatment as relatively superior or inferior, may be analyzed in terms of the following classification scheme: (I) membership in a kinship unit, (2) personal qualities, (3) achievements, (4) possessions, (5) authority, and (6) power.},

Also dealt with are such topics as: The role of ideas in social action, the motivation of economic activities, American social structure, social classes and class conflict, and the prospects for contemporary sociological theory. The whole body of essays presented here belongs in the broad field of "application" of sociological theory.

  abstract = {Structured Prosopography provides a formal model for representing prosopography: a branch of historical research that traditionally has focused on the identification of people that appear in historical sources. Since the 1990s, KCL’s Department of Digital Humanities has been involved in the development of structured prosopographical databases using a general ‘factoid-oriented’ model of structure that links people to the information about them via spots in primary sources that assert that information. Recent developments, particularly the World Wide Web, and its related technologies around the Semantic Web, have promoted the possibility to both interconnecting dispersed data, and allowing it to be queried semantically. To the purpose of making available our prosopographical databases on the Semantic Web, in this article we review the principles behind our established factoid-based model and reformulate it using a more interoperable approach, based on knowledge representation principles and formal ontologies. In particular, we are going to focus primarily on a high-level semantic analysis of the factoid notion, on its relation to other cultural heritage standards such as CIDOC-CRM, and on the modularity and extensibility of the proposed solutions.},

The root is *\emph{kṯr}, "skilful", which is also the name of the god of technology (DUL\textsuperscript{3}, s.v. *\emph{kṯr} (I, III), 467-468). Their seven statues had face, hands and feet covered in silver. Each held a bronze \emph{gu}\textsubscript{2}-\emph{a}-\emph{tum} (on this tool, see Pasquali, \emph{NABU }2022/3).},

  note = {\\ \\ ☞ In this paper Pasquali argues that the term \emph{u}\textsubscript{3}-\emph{ra}\textsuperscript{(ki)} used to describe two garments attested in the Archives refers to the Cilician city of Ura. The author investigates the occurrences of the garment \textsuperscript{tug₂}gun\textsubscript{3} \emph{u}\textsubscript{3}-\emph{ra}\textsuperscript{(ki)}, suggesting it was a precious fabric often delivered with a sheath and dagger to men. The \textsuperscript{tug₂}gun\textsubscript{3} can also be delivered to a god (e.g.\emph{ }ʾ\emph{a}\textsubscript{3}-\emph{da-bal}): the author thus discusses the parallel between the divine couple Ḥadda-baʿal/\textsuperscript{d}BAD-mi\textsubscript{2} and the royal couple in the marriage ritual. The author further explores the occurrences of \emph{du-ru}\textsubscript{12}-\emph{ru}\textsubscript{12}/\emph{rum}\textsubscript{2} (stole, peplos) and its \emph{u}\textsubscript{3}-\emph{ra}\textsuperscript{(ki)} variant. Regarding the reading of the term \emph{u}\textsubscript{3}-\emph{ra}\textsuperscript{(ki)}, Pasquali observes that it has been wrongly interpreted as libir-ra, whereas the signs u\textsubscript{3} and libir are different. On the basis of a few occurrences of the term \emph{u}\textsubscript{3}-\emph{ra}\textsuperscript{ }with the determinative for place (ki), he then concludes it may refer to a GN. The city of Ura in Cilicia is the most plausible candidate, as it appears in later documents from Ugarit. The term thus belongs to the group of GNs used to describe the provenance of certain garments or fabrics, such as Mari or Armi.},

In their paper, Biga and Steinkeller suggest the identification of the GN Dugurasu with Egypt: in doing so, they reject Pasquali’s earlier interpretation of \emph{nab-ḫu} as “rock crystal”. Pasquali brings further evidence in favor of his interpretation.},

The focus of the article is on real estate documents inside and outside the archives and the aim is to investigate whether there were restrictions on the sale of real estate property and whether the legal information found on the kudurru inscriptions can be used to reconstruct documents that must have existed in the archives.},

  abstract = {This paper examines the role of structural embeddedness as an organising phenomenon within interdependent networks. While conceptual and philosophical in nature, data from a longitudinal ethnographic case study of an icon tourism destination is used to illustrate new framings of this concept. This method of research enables deeper insights to be attained that add both explanation and understanding to our current appreciation of the interdependent organizing phenomena. The case data illustrate how the network has structural attributes of heterogeneity, interconnection and reciprocity that contribute to its anti-hierarchical state. This enables an infinite number of structural possibilities to occur, some of which can be developed to form strategic capabilities that belong to the network. Assisting this process, is a symbiotic and mutual participation from the interdependent actors which critiques the notion of structural redundancy. The paper illustrates how the aggregated patterns have formed in the network and how reciprocal obligation has built long term exchange patterns that contribute to forming the embedded macroculture.},

It highlights developments in Marxist, feminist, and historical approaches, the repatriation of kinship studies, various aspects of lesbian/gay kinship, and issues bearing on the new reproductive technologies. Contemporary kinship studies tend to be historically grounded; tend to focus on everyday experiences, understandings, and representations of gender, power, and difference; and tend to devote considerable analytic attention to themes of contradiction, paradox, and ambivalence.]},

In Bioarchaeology and Behavior, Megan Perry presents a collection of essays that aim a spotlight on the investigation of the ancient inhabitants of the circum-Mediterranean area. Composed of eight diverse papers, this volume synthesizes recent research on human skeletal remains and their archaeological and historical contexts in this region. Utilizing an environmental, social, and political framework, the contributors present scholarly case studies on such topics as the region's mortuary archaeology, genetic investigations of migration patterns, and the ancient populations' health, disease, and diet. Other key anthropological issues addressed in this volume include the effects of the domestication of plants and animals, the rise of state-level formations,...},

Here the idea is put forward that the text deals with an agreement between the two states, Emar and Ebla, with special reference to fields, bought by Ebla, and given to Emar for management. The document is best understood within the framework of the commercial colony (bad) which formed the core of the economy of Ebla.},

This phenomenon is examined based on the glosses of the so-called “Vocabolario di Ebla” (VE). It is argued that the interchange pertains to the graphic rather than the phonological level, and that, at least in manuscript B of VE, the interchange is subject to a precise phonological conditioning: /r/ is spelled r when occurring as a geminate or as the onset of a stressed syllable, and l elsewhere. This hypothesis, in turn, provides first insights into Eblaite word accent.},

It is argued that plene writing here denotes a specific intonation contour, most probably a sharply rising melody. Main conclusions concerning its use: (1) Only polar questions carry interrogative intonation, not so wh-questions. (2) In alternative questions, only the first half usually carries interrogative intonation, not the second. (3) The (verbal or nominal) predicate of the sentence is the default carrier of interrogative intonation, but other elements may take over this role if they are focussed. (4) Interrogative intonation is always located on the final syllable of the affected phrase. (5) This implies that interrogative intonation regularly shifts onto enclitics, such as verbal object clitics, if the phrase contains any.},

The main focus is a group of fragments that may belong to the standard of the king (en). According my reconstruction, Ebla officials carried standards with one figure during state ceremonies, possibly a mark of their role at court, while the king and queen carried standards with three figures, possibly hinting at the concept of kingship at Ebla.},

The overarching conference theme "Text and Image" addressed a topic of fundamental importance for historical research on ancient Near Eastern cultures and societies. The aim of the conference was to stimulate an interdisciplinary dialogue between the closely related, but increasingly diverging disciplines of Near Eastern Archaeology and Assyriology. Fifty-one articles are published in three languages, including contributions to the main topic and to a number of workshops organized in the context of the RAI, as well as reports on an extraordinary session devoted to cultural heritage},

  abstract = {The study of the semiotics of palaces in the Ancient Near East and Ancient Egypt provides the historian with diverse information as size and type of architecture demonstrate the kind of representation chosen by rulers towards their world. Some features were adopted from temples in order to stage the appearance of the ruler like a divine epiphany. Some further integrate a temple within the palace, showcasing the desire of the ruler to live with a specific deity under one roof for divine support and protection. The importance of this ruler can also be reflected by the size of the throne room and the number of columns, showing as well a hierarchy in the use of space within the whole building complex and its different units. For instance, the presence of a rather intimate throne room or a second small throne room points to space for confidential exchange between the ruler and his visitors. The capacity of storerooms additionally gives us insight into the economic power standing behind the palace. The comparison of different elements between palatial and domestic architecture also proves helpful in identifying the origins of particular components.0Exploration of such semiotics was initiated with the publication of the first palace volume in 2018 (Verlag der ÖAW, Vienna) following a conference held in London 2013. The present volume stands in direct continuation and is the result of a second palace conference that took place at the 10th ICAANE 2016 in Vienna. Besides introducing other palaces in Egypt and Nubia, this volume is dedicated primarily to Near Eastern palaces which are presented and studied by prominent experts in this field},

  abstract = {Excavations at Ebla started in 1964. In 2014, fifty years later, an international congress was organized to try and highlight the contribution of this excavation to the knowledge of the history, philology and art history of the Ancient Near East. This book collects the papers from this international congress. Bringing together established and junior scholars from various areas, Ebla and Beyond aims at fostering the dialogue between experts in different fields of the history and archaeology of Syria in the Bronze and Iron Ages and between experienced foreign scholars and the latest generation of scholars of the School of Oriental Archaeology of Rome. The contributions in the book on the one hand show how much the discoveries at Ebla during forty-seven years of fieldwork have changed the way of understanding the developmental trajectory of Syria from the third through the first millennium BC. On the other hand, the work of the scholars from Rome and elsewhere proves how, even in difficult times for field archaeology, it is possible to exploit the results of a long-standing enterprise of this kind in a fruitful and sometimes revolutionary way},

  abstract = {Community detection is a major issue in network analysis. This paper combines a socio-historical approach with an experimental reconstruction of programs to investigate the early automation of clique detection algorithms, which remains one of the unsolved NP-complete problems today. The research led by the archaeologist Jean-Claude Gardin from the 1950s on non-numerical information and graph analysis is retraced to demonstrate the early contributions of social sciences and humanities. The limited recognition and reception of Gardin's innovative computer application to the humanities are addressed through two factors, in addition to the effects of historiography and bibliographies on the recording, discoverability, and reuse of scientific productions: (1) funding policies, evidenced by the transfer of research effort on graph applications from temporary interdisciplinary spaces to disciplinary organizations related to the then-emerging field of computer science; and (2) the erratic careers of algorithms, in which efficiency, flaws, corrections, and authors' status, were determining factors.},

  abstract = {"Amanda Podany here takes readers on a vivid tour through a thousand years of ancient Near Eastern history, from 2300 to 1300 BCE, paying particular attention to the lively interactions that took place between the great kings of the day. Allowing them to speak in their own words, Podany reveals how these Near Eastern leaders and their ambassadors devised a remarkably sophisticated system of diplomacy and of trade that extended from the Aegean Sea to Afghanistan, and from the Baltic to central Africa. The allied kings referred to one another as "brothers," kings with equal power and influence who were tied to one another through peace treaties and powerful obligations. They were also often bound together as in-laws, as a result of marrying one another's daughters. These rulers had almost never met one another in person, but they felt a strong connection--a real brotherhood--which gradually made wars between them less common. A remarkable account of a pivotal moment in world history--the establishment of international diplomacy thousands of years before the United Nations--Brotherhood of kings offers a vibrantly written history of the region often known as the cradle of civilization"--Provided by publisher.},

  abstract = {"This sweeping history of the ancient Near East (Mesopotamia, Syria, Anatolia, Iran) takes readers on a journey from the creation of the world's first cities to the conquest of Alexander the Great. The book is built around the life stories of many ancient men and women, from kings, priestesses, and merchants to bricklayers, musicians, and weavers. Their habits of daily life, beliefs, triumphs, and crises, and the changes that they faced over time are explored through their written words and the archaeological remains of the buildings, cities, and empires in which they lived. Rather than chronicling three thousand years of kingdoms, the book instead creates a tapestry of life stories through which readers come to know specific individuals from many walks of life, and to understand their places within the broad history of events and institutions in the ancient Near East. These life stories are preserved on ancient cuneiform tablets, which allow us to trace, for example, the career of a weaver as she advanced to became a supervisor of a workshop, listen to a king trying to persuade his generals to prepare for a siege, and feel the pain of a starving young couple who were driven to sell all four of their young children into slavery during a famine. What might seem at first glance to be a remote and inaccessible ancient culture proves to be a comprehensible world, one that bequeathed to us many of our institutions and beliefs, a truly fascinating place to visit"--},

  abstract = {Excavations at Ebla started in 1964. In 2014, fifty years later, an international congress was organized to try and highlight the contribution of this excavation to the knowledge of the history, philology and art history of the Ancient Near East. This book collects the papers from this international congress. Bringing together established and junior scholars from various areas, Ebla and Beyond aims at fostering the dialogue between experts in different fields of the history and archaeology of Syria in the Bronze and Iron Ages and between experienced foreign scholars and the latest generation of scholars of the School of Oriental Archaeology of Rome. The contributions in the book on the one hand show how much the discoveries at Ebla during forty-seven years of fieldwork have changed the way of understanding the developmental trajectory of Syria from the third through the first millennium BC. On the other hand, the work of the scholars from Rome and elsewhere proves how, even in difficult times for field archaeology, it is possible to exploit the results of a long-standing enterprise of this kind in a fruitful and sometimes revolutionary way},

  abstract = {In European history, the notion of consanguinity has been treated as self-evident and as generally meaning — as it does for us — a blood tie created through either the mother or the father. However, this has not always been the case. The concept of consanguinity we find in Roman law is very different from the modern one or even from the one to be found in later times in medieval Canon law. In Roman legal texts the term consanguinitas is used to refer exclusively to the tie derived from the paternal blood. Only the brothers and sisters born from the same father are called consanguinei (that is, sharing the same blood), even if they don't have the same mother. Children with the same mother but different fathers are not called consanguinei and don't have the legal rights stemming from consanguinitas. Thus the Roman notion of consanguinity is strictly associated with the concept of "agnation" (that is to say, kinship created only through males). This paper tries to understand this notion by placing it in the context of ancient medical theories on blood, semen and gender.},

  abstract = {Temporal perception comprises subjective phenomena such as simultaneity, successiveness, temporal order, subjective present, temporal continuity and subjective duration. These elementary temporal experiences are hierarchically related to each other. Functional system states with a duration of 30 ms are implemented by neuronal oscillations and they provide a mechanism to define successiveness. These system states are also responsible for the identification of basic events. For a sequential representation of several events time tags are allocated, resulting in an ordinal representation of such events. A mechanism of temporal integration binds successive events into perceptual units of 3 s duration. Such temporal integration, which is automatic and presemantic, is also operative in movement control and other cognitive activities. Because of the omnipresence of this integration mechanism it is used for a pragmatic definition of the subjective present. Temporal continuity is the result of a semantic connection between successive integration intervals. Subjective duration is known to depend on mental load and attentional demand, high load resulting in long time estimates. In the hierarchical model proposed, system states of 30 ms and integration intervals of 3 s, together with a memory store, provide an explanatory neuro-cognitive machinery for differential subjective duration.},

Il Mondo 2 è quello mentale o psicologico: il mondo dei nostri sentimenti di piacere e di dolore, dei nostri pensieri e delle nostre percezioni. Ma è sul Mondo 3 che Popper sofferma più a lungo l'attenzione, quello che include i prodotti della mente umana. È il mondo delle lingue e dei racconti, delle storie e dei miti religiosi, delle teorie scientifiche e delle costruzioni matematiche, in cui trovano ugualmente posto l'"Amleto" di Shakespeare, la "Quinta" di Beethoven e la Costituzione americana, oggetti - come dimostra l'autore - altrettanto reali degli altri.},

In the ancient Near East, mortuary practices created ancestors, evident both archaeologically and textually, and ancestors were intimately tied to social structures that shaped both the nature of the social group and its history. This paper focuses on the third-millennium settlement complex of Tell Banat, on the left bank of the Euphrates River, Syria. Mortuary practices there included multistage burials in which acts such as the disarticulation and burning of skeletal remains destroyed the individual identities of the deceased and rendered them cultural artifacts to be used in forming collective identities, identities that had their origins in an inclusive, mobile, pastoralist society. Paradoxically, the physical manifestation of those inclusive relations in mortuary practice led to the urbanization of this region and the eventual predominance of an exclusionary social system.},

Work at the site has revealed evidence of changing social ideologies and organization that broaden our current understandings of urbanization and state formation. Porter emphasizes how the continued construction of monumental mortuary mounds from the early to late third millennium, and the nature of burial practices within them, highlight the collective nature of the deceased. Ancestor traditions mediate an imagery of unity and parity and these traditions give evidence of a corporate socio-political system. In the subsequent period of state consolidation, corporate imagery was adopted by the elite as social legitimation. Yet such manipulation of traditional social practices also served to constrain the degree to which elites could exert autonomous power.},

  abstract = {"From their domestication to their taboo, the role of pigs in the ancient Near East is one of the most complicated topics in archaeology. Rejecting monocausal explanations, this book adopts an evolutionary approach and uses zooarchaeology and texts to unravel the cultural significance of swine from the Paleolithic to today. Five major themes emerge: The domestication of the pig from wild boar in the Pre-Pottery Neolithic, the unique roles that pigs developed in agricultural economies before and after the development of complex societies, the raising of swine in cities, the shifting ritual roles of pigs, and the formation and development of the pork taboo in Judaism and, later, Islam. The development of this taboo has inspired much academic debate. I argue that the well-known taboo described in Leviticus reflects the intention of the Biblical writers to develop an image of a glorious pastoral ancestry for a heroic Israelite past, something they achieved by tying together existing food traditions. These included a taboo on pigs, which was developed early in the Iron Age during conflicts between Israelites and Philistines and was revitalized by the Biblical writers. The taboo persisted and mutated, gaining strength over the next two and a half millennia. In particular, the pig taboo became a point of contention in the ethno-political struggles between Jewish and Greco-Roman cultures in the Levant. Ultimately, it was this continued evolution within the context of ethnic and religious politics that gave the pig taboo the strength it has today"--},

The inherent fuzziness in complex systems definitions is complicated by the unclear relation among these central processes: does self-organisation emerge or does it set the preconditions for emergence? Does complexity arise by adaptation or is complexity necessary for adaptation to arise? The inevitable consequence of the current impasse is miscommunication among scientists within and across disciplines. We propose a set of concepts, together with their possible information-theoretic interpretations, which can be used to facilitate the Complex Systems Science discourse. Our hope is that the suggested information-theoretic baseline may promote consistent communications among practitioners, and provide new insights into the field.

  abstract = {This essay explores the consequences for historians’ research of the twinned transnational and digitized turns. The accelerating digitization of primary and secondary sources and the rise of full-text web-based search to access information within them has transformed historians’ research practice, radically diminishing the role of place-specific prior expertise as a prerequisite to discovery. Indeed, we can now find information without knowing where to look. This has incited remarkably little reflection among mainstream historians, but the consequences are profound. What has become newly possible? How do the new digital affordances relate to the current boom in transnational topics and approaches? How do the reach, speed, and granularity of digitized search impact our ability to reconstruct the supranational past? This essay heralds the novel forms of knowledge-generation made possible by technological transformations. It also attempts an accounting of all the ancillary learning that international research in an analog world once required. What kinds of knowledge and insight did place-based research across borders instill? What are the intellectual and political consequences of leaving that behind?},

In this world, gods lived among humans. The two groups shared the world with one another, each playing a special role in maintaining order in the cosmos. Humans also shared aspects of a godlike nature. Even in their natural condition, humans enjoyed a taste of the divine state. Indeed, gods not only lived among humans, but also they lived inside them, taking up residence in the physical body. As such, human nature was actually a composite of humanity and divinity. Putthoff offers new insights into the ancients' understanding of humanity's relationship with the gods, providing a comparative study of this phenomenon from the third millennium BCE to the first century CE.},

The authors represent a highly international mix of leading academics whose expertise brings alive the people, places and times of the remote past. The emphasis lies firmly on the political and social histories of the states and communities under investigation. The individual chapters present the key textual and material sources underpinning the historical reconstruction, giving special attention to the most recent archaeological finds and how they have impacted our interpretation. The first volume covers the long period from the mid-tenth millennium to the late third millennium BC and presents the history of the Near East in ten chapters "From the Beginnings to Old Kingdom Egypt and the Dynasty of Akkad". Key topics include the domestication of animals and plants, the first permanent settlements, the subjugation and appropriation of the natural environment, the emergence of complex states and belief systems, the invention of the earliest writing systems and the wide-ranging trade networks that linked diverse population groups across deserts, mountains and oceans"--},

Subjects—485 lower income, educated women with extensive experience of breast feeding. Intervention—Women were offered all available contraceptives for use after birth. Those who chose the lactational amenorrhoea method were taught the method, screened for the study, and followed for 12 months to determine the risk of pregnancy when the method was used. Main outcome measures—Life table pregnancy rates during correct and incorrect use of the method, censored monthly in the event of sexual abstinence or the use of another contraceptive method. Results—The lactational amenorrhoea method was 99\% effective when used correctly (that is, during lactational amenorrhoea and full or nearly full breast feeding for up to six months). At 12 months the effectiveness during amenorrhoea dropped to 97\%. Conclusions—The lactational amenorrhoea method provided as much protection from pregnancy as non-breast feeding women experience with non-medicated intrauterine devices and barrier methods. The contraceptive effect of lactation cannot be attributed to lactational or postpartum abstinence.}

The archaeological record contains hundreds of situations in which societies developed long-term sustainable relationships with their environmentsÑand thousands in which the relationships were destructive. Charles Redman demonstrates that much can be learned from an improved understanding of peoples who, through seemingly rational decisions, degraded their environments and threatened their own survival. By discussing archaeological case studies from around the worldÑfrom the deforestation of the Mayan lowlands to soil erosion in ancient Greece to the almost total depletion of resources on Easter IslandÑRedman reveals the long-range coevolution of culture and environment and clearly shows the impact that ancient peoples had on their world. These case studies focus on four themes: habitat transformation and animal extinctions, agricultural practices, urban growth, and the forces that accompany complex society. They show that humankind\&\#39;s commitment to agriculture has had cultural consequences that have conditioned our perception of the environment and reveal that societies before European contact did not necessarily live the utopian existences that have been popularly supposed. Whereas most books on this topic tend to treat human societies as mere reactors to environmental stimuli, Redman\&\#39;s volume shows them to be active participants in complex and evolving ecological relationships. Human Impact on Ancient Environments demonstrates how archaeological research can provide unique insights into the nature of human stewardship of the Earth and can permanently alter the way we think about humans and the environment.},

This selection of texts focuses mostly on less well-known text types of the time, reflecting innovations in documentary practices - some isolated to the period, others precursive to the Kassite period.

Beginning sometime after 2400 BCE, the earliest tablets from Mari, Ebla, and Nagar provide insight into the political and cultural geography of Northern Mesopotamia. About 5000 tablets from Ebla come from an administrative archive that was preserved by the fiery destruction and abandonment of Palace G. The tablets depict a dynamic world, where nearly constant warfare meant unstable frontiers and shifting alliances. At the beginning of the Early Bronze Age, a process of regionalization and ruralization began, as the shared traditions of the Chalcolithic gave way to diverse new cultures. Although Northern Mesopotamia in the third millennium was not yet 'Assyria', several elements were already in place that would contribute to later Assyrian political culture.},

It draws together a team of outstanding international scholars and presents an authoritative and panoramic critical survey of the field.   The volume is divided into three parts. The first part examines the classical tradition. Included here are critical discussions of Comte, Spencer, Marx, Durkheim, Weber, Simmel, Mead, Freud, Mannheim and classical feminist thought. This part conveys the classical tradition as a living resource in social theory, it demonstrates not only the critical significance of classical writings, but their continuing relevance.  The second part moves on to examine the terrain of contemporary social theory. The contributions discuss the significance and strengths and weaknesses of structural functionalism, recent Marxian theory, critical theory, symbolic interactionism, phenomenology, ethnomethodology, exchange theory, rational choice, contemporary feminism, multiculturalism, postmodernism, the thought of Foucault and Habermas, and figurational sociology. The reader gains a comprehensive and informed picture of the key issues and central figures of the day.  The final part ranges over the key debates in current social theory. Questions relating to positivism, metatheorizing, cultural studies, consumption, sexualities, the body, globalism, nationalism, socialism, knowledge societies, ethics and morality, as well as post-social relations are fully discussed. The dilemmas and promise of contemporary social theory are revealed with pinpoint accuracy.},

By examining how mercantilist thought developed in the eighteenth-century domain of Toas, Luke Roberts shows how economic ideas were generated at the regional level. During the Edo period (1600-1867), Japan was divided into over 230 competitive states, many of which wished to reduce the dominance of the shogun's economy. The seventeenth-century Japanese economy was based on samurai notions of service - especially the duty performed by the dominal lord to the shogun - and the rhetoric of political economy that centred on the lord and the samurai class. This 'economy of service,' however, led to crises in deforestation and land degradation, government fiscal insolvency and increasingly corrupt tax levies, and finally a loss of faith in government.},

I begin by outlining the two properties of computers that I argue define digital history: they process data and (as Janet H. Murray noted) provide an immersive and interactive medium. I then examine how digital historians in the United States have employed those affordances. That process has proceeded unevenly, with computers having been used as a medium before they were employed to process data, and has produced additive forms—digital archives, digital public history, data analysis published in print—that rely on existing formats rather than on the affordances of computers. While such forms are a necessary step toward a more fully realized digital history, their prevalence suggests that it will take some time for that process to play out. The final section looks to recently published and forthcoming long-form digital arguments for the direction of that development. Examples from Stanford University Press's Digital Projects series point to some of the ways that the data analysis and the immersive and interactive medium of the computer might be combined.},

The reasons for this are varied: digital historians have often preferred to create scholarship for public audiences, or they have pursued forms of scholarship which do not lend themselves to explicit interpretation. But we contend that digital historians have not had sufficient models of patterns of historical argumentation compatible with digital historical research. In this introduction, we read the articles by Rachel Midura and Leonardo Barleta that appear in this special section, and a series of other articles, in order to show the patterns of historical argumentation that digital historians can pursue. A companion website features versions of the articles by Midura and Barleta, as well as eight additional previously published articles, annotated by their authors to highlight how they developed their historical arguments so they can serve as models for argumentative digital history.},

  abstract = {The numerical form of accounting has been interpreted as a use of metaphor (Morgan, Accounting, Organizations and Society, pp. 447–486, 1988). The dominance of quantification in accounting has also, more conventionally, been legitimated by claims to the representational accuracy of numbers and a model of scientific theory and practice (Mattessich, Accounting and Analytical Methods, Irwin, 1962; Chambers, Accounting Evaluation and Economic Behaviour, Prentice-Hall, 1966; Accounting, Organizations and Society, pp. 167–180, 1980). In this paper the preference for quantification in accounting is explained alternatively in terms of the development of inscriptions that enable action at a distance (Latour, Science in Action, Open University Press, 1987). The development of accounting is considered in terms of a continuing refinement of mobile, stable and combinable inscriptions that expedite long distance control. The paper concludes that studies of accounting metaphor are incomplete if they cannot address the processes that adjudicate the choices and production of metaphor.},

The latest attempt to do so is Quentin Deluermoz and Pierre Singaravélou's A Past of Possibilities: A History of What Could Have Been. A stimulating, if somewhat meandering, book of essayistic reflections on historical speculation, A Past of Possibilities highlights the challenges of, and continuing opportunities for, historicizing the field that today is called “counterfactual history.” Ever since the mid-nineteenth century, historians have recognized the presence of “what-ifs” in historical scholarship, but they have disagreed about what to call them. For over a century, they have embraced a bewildering array of phrases, including “imaginary history,” “hypothetical history,” “subjunctive history,” “conjectural history,” “conditional history,” “probable history,” “iffy history,” “alternate history,” “allohistory,” “uchronia,” “historical might-have-beens,” and “historical ifs.” Deluermoz and Singaravélou continue this tradition by employing many different terms for historical counterfactuals in their effort to explain their increasing prominence. This conceptual pluralism, which is rooted in an interdisciplinary methodology, enables the authors to arrive at important insights about the field of counterfactual history. However, it also prevents them from generating a systematic argument that builds toward a larger conclusion. A Past of Possibilities is thus an important study that nevertheless highlights the need for further research.},

  abstract = {"Irrigation has long been of interest in the study of the past. Many early civilizations were located in river valleys, and irrigation was of great economic importance for many early states because of the key role it played in producing an agricultural surplus, which was the main source of wealth and the basis of political power for the elites who controlled it. Agricultural surplus was also necessary to maintain the very features of statehood, such as urbanism, full-time labor specialization, state institutions, and status hierarchy. Yet, the presence of large-scale or complex irrigation systems does not necessarily mean that they were under centralized control. While some early states organized the construction, operation, and maintenance of irrigation works and resolved conflicts related to water distribution, other early governments left most of the management to local farmers and controlled only the surplus. The cross-cultural studies in this volume reexamine the role of irrigation in early states. Ranging geographically from South America and the southwestern United States to North Africa, the Middle East, and Asia, they describe the physical attributes and environments of early irrigation systems; various methods for empirical investigation of ancient irrigation; and irrigation's economic, sociopolitical, and cosmological dimensions. Through their interdisciplinary perspectives, the authors-all experts in the field of irrigation studies-advance both methodological and theoretical approaches to understanding irrigation in early civilizations"--},

Cultural differences influence the traits and attributes that are internalized by one set of followers and not others. At the nation-state level, political leaders do arise who mesmerize their constituents charismatically, but too frequently that appeal is episodic, transient, and easily forfeited. Most of all, successful political leadership is more than behaving charismatically; delivering results in the form of economic growth, educational advances, health and medical services, and national self-respect are more important and more lasting. David Bell brings all of those considerations to the fore in a remarkable book that analyzes the charismatic appeals of Washington, Napoleon, Louverture, Paoli, and Bolivar, and raises important questions about the force of charisma in history.},

We continue the process of revision by accepting his ideal-typical concepts of bureaucratic and patrimonial administration, but subject them to theoretical and historical reinterpretation and application. Our reading of historical change as it relates to bureaucracy leads us to question Weber's interpretations. His conceptualization of bureaucracy in terms of rational-legal-authority and formal rationality fails to take account of the existence and use of power within and outside of organizations, and of the persistence of patrimonial features. The use of power produces conflict and pathologies. When these serve the legitimate values and interests of participants and actors in the organizational environment, they can have benign consequences. The persistence of patrimonial features, rather than signalling the survival of dysfunctional atavisms, can promote administrative effectiveness by mitigating conflict and promoting organizational loyalty, discipline, and efficiency.},

Involving such transpersonal relations of being and experience, kinship takes its place in the same ontological regime as magic, gift exchange, sorcery, and witchcraft. Une modeste proposition pour résoudre l'équation, vieille de 150 ans, de ce qu'est la parenté, sa spécificité, à savoir la mutualité d'existence: des personnes qui sont membres les unes des autres, qui participent à l'existence les unes des autres. La « mutualité d'existence » vaut aussi pour la constitution de lien de parenté par la construction sociale et la procréation, bien qu'elle tienne compte de « la mystérieuse efficacité de la relationalité » (Viveiros de Castro), de la manière dont les parents vivent les vies et meurent les morts des uns et des autres. La parenté, en mettant en jeu ces relations transpersonnelles d'existence et d'expérience, s'inscrit dans le même ordre ontologique que la magie, l'échange de cadeaux, la sorcellerie et la magie noire.},

As the cliché goes, kings continue to die spectacular deaths only to remain subjects of vitality and long life.

The divine, the stranger, the numinous, the bestial—the implications for understanding kings and their sacred office are not limited to questions of sovereignty, but issues ranging from temporality and alterity to piracy and utopia; indeed, the authors argue that kingship offers us a unique window into the fundamental dilemmas concerning the very nature of power, meaning, and the human condition. With the wit and sharp analysis characteristic of these two thinkers, this volume opens up new avenues for how an anthropological study of kingship might proceed in the 21st century.},

  abstract = {Among several administrative sectors, the Archives of Ebla (Syria, ca. 2380–2330 B.C.) document month after month, over forty years, the expenditures of textile production (the first manufacture of the time) giving substance to an archaic society, also in relation with the neighboring states. An entire new province – northern Syria of the third millennium B.C. – is returned to the Ancient Near East studies, and, a unique case, on the basis of the complete documentation kept by a central administration.  This volume includes 1 yearly text and 24 monthly documents selected because they present sections concerning groups of men ordered according to crafts, women employed in menial works, and men passed in review in relation with military expeditions. A concluding essay is the first attempt to give a reconstruction of the palace organization of Ebla and the forces of the recruited army. One text lists the gifts to the members of the court (fixing their rank in this way) on the occasion of the marriage of the only daughter of the royal couple with a prince of Kiš, the major power of the time; in another one the funerary gifts to a princess are registered. Detailed indices complete the volume.},

  abstract = {Max Weber, widely considered a founder of sociology and the modern social sciences, visited the United States in 1904 with his wife Marianne. The trip was a turning point in Weber's life and it played a pivotal role in shaping his ideas, yet until now virtually our only source of information about the trip was Marianne Weber's faithful but not always reliable 1926 biography of her husband.Max Weber in America carefully reconstructs this important episode in Weber's career, and shows how the subsequent critical reception of Weber's work was as American a story as the trip itself. Lawrence Scaff provides new details about Weber's visit to the United States--what he did, what he saw, whom he met and why, and how these experiences profoundly influenced Weber's thought on immigration, capitalism, science and culture, Romanticism, race, diversity, Protestantism, and modernity. Scaff traces Weber's impact on the development of the social sciences in the United States following his death in 1920, examining how Weber's ideas were interpreted, translated, and disseminated by American scholars such as Talcott Parsons and Frank Knight, and how the Weberian canon, codified in America, was reintroduced into Europe after World War II. A landmark work by a leading Weber scholar, Max Weber in America will fundamentally transform our understanding of this influential thinker and his place in the history of sociology and the social sciences.},

La maggior parte dei documenti conservati all’interno degli Archivi sono di carattere economico, amministrativo, e diplomatico e offrono informazioni preziose per la ricostruzione della storia politica ed economica della città. A questi si aggiungono, in numero assai inferiore, testi letterari (incantesimi, inni) e lessicali (testi lessicali monoligui e bilingui). L’obiettivo della ricerca è proporre un modello della società eblaita basato sui dati presenti nella documentazione degli Archivi Reali: il presente studio utilizza quindi come parole chiave i termini che nei testi di Ebla contraddistinguono le categorie professionali, al fine di delineare un modello che permetta di comprendere i livelli di interazione e la gerarchia che caratterizzava le componenti della società eblaita attraverso una metodologia di matrice sociologica e storico-sociale. Ciascun termine chiave è analizzato in chiave lessicale, amministrativa, e storica, al fine di delineare le principali componenti del tessuto sociale: l’analisi dei dati così raccolti mira a delineare un quadro generale dell’organizzazione sociale di Ebla alla metà del III millennio a.C..},

Eles organizaram e armazenaram dados contabilísticos referentes a mais de trinta anos de actividades do Palácio G. Os padrões textuais recorrentes que caracterizam o corpus administrativo são o resultado desta abordagem baseada na rotina. A capacidade de ver padrões recorrentes nos registos textuais é fundamental quando se lida com um corpus administrativo: contudo, esta capacidade perde-se quando os padrões ficam submersos num mar de dados. Neste artigo, defendo que os aspectos teóricos do data mining se aproximam dos princípios teóricos e metodológicos da abordagem histórica. O data mining afigura-se como uma técnica útil para a identificação de clusters de documentos e informação relevante, que, de outra forma, permaneceriam ocultos. Além disso, o reconhecimento de padrões textuais é fundamental para abordar tópicos como o estudo da sociedade: qualquer investigação sócio-histórica, na medida em que lida com problemas complexos, requer o tratamento de múltiplas variáveis interligadas. No entanto, nem todos os tópicos de investigação exigem tal abordagem. Eu defino como 'limiar de visibilidade' o patamar para além do qual as abordagens digitais são extremamente úteis (se não indispensáveis). O posicionamento desta interface é relativo e subjectivo.},

What humanists mostly work on, and which forms much of the contents of our growing repositories, are digital surrogates of originally analog artefacts. But is the data model upon which many of those surrogates are based – embedded markup – adequate for the task? Or does it in fact inhibit reusability and flexibility? To enhance interoperability of resources and tools, some changes to the standard markup model are needed. Markup could be removed from the text and stored in standoff form. The versions of which many cultural heritage texts are composed could also be represented externally, and computed automatically. These changes would not disrupt existing data representations, which could be imported without significant data loss. They would also enhance automation and ease the increasing burden on the modern digital humanist.},

  abstract = {The contributions in this volume -- resulting from an international conference held in 2016 at the Center for Advanced Studies of Ludwig- Maximilians-University Munich and supported by the LMU Graduate School for Ancient Studies 'Distant Worlds' -- aim to integrate material remains, textual sources, and the visual record regarding ancient Near Eastern temple inventories of the third and second millennia BCE. The conference encouraged researchers with archaeological and philological backgrounds to engage in holistic approaches to the constitution of sacred space and to the societal function as well as ideological and economic impacts of sacred gifting. Its focus on objects and practices led to a fruitful exchange with increased emphasis on entire assemblages instead of exclusive treatments of distinct object categories or text genres. Several contributions in this volume build on archaeological and textual evidence that was excavated in the early twentieth century but remains in continuous need for contextual and synthetic analyses. Others discuss more recent excavations undertaken with closer attention to contextual and stratigraphic details and exploiting new opportunities for scientific analyses. The temples under consideration range geographically from modern-day Iraq (Ur, Nippur, Khafajeh, Iscali, Assur) and Syria (Mari, Tell Bazi, Aleppo) to Turkey (Bogazköy), and chronologically from the Early to the Late Bronze Age (c. 2800-1200 BCE). Discussions start off from diverse sources such as administrative texts, votive inscriptions, small-scale finds, architectural installations, or three- and two-dimensional figurative artefacts but all contribute to an overall goal: To better understand the entwinement of the things, images, and practices that changed a physical space into a locus of encounter between humans and the divine},

The BPS tools include 1) functionality to import TEI documents and convert to our data model, 2) a disambiguation engine to associate names to persons based upon configurable heuristic rules, 3) an assertion model that supports flexible researcher curation and tracks provenance, 4) social network analysis and 5) graph visualization tools to analyze and understand social relations, and 6) a workspace model supporting exploratory research and collaboration. We contrast the BPS model that uses configurable heuristic rules to other approaches for automated text analysis, and explain how our model facilitates interpretation by humanist researchers. We describe the significance of our curation model that improves upon traditional curation and annotation as a fact-based model by adding a more flexible model in which researchers assert conclusions or possibilities, allowing them to override automated inference, to explore ideas in what-if scenarios, and to formally publish and subscribe-to asserted annotations among colleagues, and/or with students. We detail the architecture and our implementation of the tools as a set of reusable web services and web application UI. We present an initial evaluation of researchers' experience using the tools to study corpora of cuneiform tablets, and describe plans to expand the application of the tools to a broader range of corpora.},

It is associated with rather turbulent times in Babylonia. Misfortune corresponds to several raids of Elamites in the 12th century B.C.E., leading eventually to the exile of the statue of Marduk (Paulus 2014a: 76). Its recovery by Nebuchadnezzar I (ca. 1126–1105 B.C.E.) could be seen as fortunate. After raids of Suteans},

In the last few years, discoveries of new texts and archaeological materials from the Sealand Dynasty have emerged, which expand the possibilities to fill this gap in our knowledge of Mesopotamian history. At the same time, scholars have started to revive Kassite studies using new materials, methods, and questions. While those works are groundbreaking contributions to the field, many questions about the history and chronology, archaeology, economy, language of Babylonia during this period are still unsolved. This volume brings together eleven contributions by leading scholars in the Sealand and Kassite period, approaching those questions from an archaeological, ethnological, historical, linguistic, and economical point of view. The book opens with an introduction into the history and research on Babylonia under the Sealand Dynasty and the Kassites.},

He shows how researchers extract knowledge from the widest range of sources, such as government documents, newspapers, unpublished manuscripts, images, interviews, and datasets. He demonstrates how to use archives and libraries, read sources critically, present claims supported by evidence, tell compelling stories, and much more. Featuring a wealth of examples that illustrate the methods used by seasoned experts, The Princeton Guide to Historical Research reveals that, however varied the subject matter and sources, historians share basic tools in their quest to understand people and the choices they made"--},

This book details essential strategies to create more effective data visualizations. Jonathan Schwabish walks readers through the steps of creating better graphs and how to move beyond simple line, bar, and pie charts. Through more than five hundred examples, he demonstrates the do's and don'ts of data visualization, the principles of visual perception, and how to make subjective style decisions around a chart's design. Schwabish surveys more than eighty visualization types, from histograms to horizon charts, ridgeline plots to choropleth maps, and explains how each has its place in the visual toolkit. It might seem intimidating, but everyone can learn how to create compelling, effective data visualizations.

Bringing together established and junior scholars from various areas, Ebla and Beyond aims at fostering the dialogue between experts in different fields of the history and archaeology of Syria in the Bronze and Iron Ages and between experienced foreign scholars and the latest generation of scholars of the School of Oriental Archaeology of Rome. The contributions in the book on the one hand show how much the discoveries at Ebla during forty-seven years of fieldwork have changed the way of understanding the developmental trajectory of Syria from the third through the first millennium BC. On the other hand, the work of the scholars from Rome and elsewhere proves how, even in difficult times for field archaeology, it is possible to exploit the results of a long-standing enterprise of this kind in a fruitful and sometimes revolutionary way},

The complex included a sequence of at least six tombs as well as installations with evidence of the ritual sacrifice of equids and perhaps human infants. Mortuary data allow for the consideration of the role of social status, gender, ideology, and other variables in the development of local complex society. It is hypothesized that elite ancestor veneration served to reinforce and legitimize local authority, and tomb disturbances are interpreted as desecrations intended to sever the connection between the interred ancestors and the living community. Following the period of the mortuary complex, a large, circular stone platform designated Monument 1 was constructed above it, indicating the continued special character of the Umm el-Marra acropolis in the early second millennium B.C. and the uses of social memory by the authorities of that period.},

As the director of natural science of the Rockefeller Foundation he was significantly involved in changing the leading sciences from physics to life sciences. In his 1949 article “Science and Complexity” Weaver associates this change with the location of a “great middle region” of scientific problems of organized complexity” between the “problems of simplicity” that physical sciences are concerned with and the “problems of disorganized complexity” that can be solved by probability theory and statistics. Weaver stated that “something more is needed than the mathematics of averages.” To solve such problems he pinned his hope on the power of digital computers and on interdisciplinary collaborating “mixed teams”. These quotations sound very similar to statements of Lotfi A. Zadeh’s, when he founded his theory of “Fuzzy sets”. In this contribution we consider the theory of Fuzzy Sets as an approach to solve Weaver’s “problems of organized complexity”.},

The data enabled us to compare the theoretical cumulative probability of conception among breastfeeding women who had unprotected intercourse irrespective of their menstrual status with that of those who had unprotected intercourse only during lactational amenorrhoea. Breastfeeding alone is not an effective form of contraception, since all the women in our study resumed normal ovulation while still breastfeeding. However, among women who have unprotected intercourse only during lactational amenorrhoea but adopt other contraceptive measures when they resume menstruation, only 1·7\% would have become pregnant during the first 6 months of amenorrhoea, only 7\% after 12 months, and only 13\% after 24 months. Thus for our women it would be possible to extend the Bellagio Consensus Conference guidelines which stated that lactational amenorrhoea can only be relied on as a contraceptive for the first 6 months post-partum in women who are fully or almost fully breastfeeding. The lactational amenorrhoea method can be relied on for excellent contraceptive protection in the first 6 months of breastfeeding, irrespective of when supplements are introduced into the baby's diet; for women who continue to breastfeed the method can also give good protection for up to 12 months post partum. Once menstruation has returned, other forms of contraception are essential to prevent pregnancy.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

In this article I will provide a new overview of the illnesses, symptoms, and treatments that are mentioned in the Kassite medical letters. I will first discuss and reassess which letters belong to this group or “corpus” based on recent collations, after which an edition of the previously unpublished letter N 969 will be provided. The edition is followed by an overview of the illnesses and symptoms in the Kassite medical letters based on the redefined corpus and supported by collations and new readings. I will finish with some new considerations of medical treatment as presented in the Kassite medical letters.},

It is found that the prerequisite functions of a market economy listed by Polanyi-the allocation of consumer goods, land, and labor through the supply-demand-price mechanism; risk-bearing organized as a market function; and loan markets-were all present in the ancient Near East. Although Polanyi criticized stage theories with their "predilection for continuity" he imposed his own version of continuity on history in lumping together many thousands of years under the rubric of "archaic society." This perspective prevented him from recognizing that ancient Mesopotamia experienced lengthy and significant periods of unfettered market activity as well as periods of pervasive state regulation.},

Ricoeur identifies three “primary” symbols as being particularly important: the stain (or defilement), sin, and guilt. But these symbols also have “existential” meanings, of being impure, of being sinful, of being guilty. The metaphor “brings to language the implicit semantics of the symbol”: the metaphorical utterance clarifies the assimilation of one thing to another and of us to things that the symbol confuses.},

In actual fact, communication has been quite infrequent. In the United States, at least, there seem to be no doctoral programs in economics that require their students to master the psychological literature of rational choice, and no psychology programs that insist that their students become acquainted with economic theories of rationality.

Simon, who received the 1978 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences \&quot;for his pioneering work on decision-making processes in economic organizations.\&quot;  The ability to apply reason to the choice of actions is supposed to be one of the defining characteristics of our species. In the first two chapters, the author explores the nature and limits of human reason, comparing and evaluating the major theoretical frameworks that have been erected to explain reasoning processes. He also discusses the interaction of thinking and emotion in the choice of our actions. In the third and final chapter, the author applies the theory of bounded rationality to social institutions and human behavior, and points out the problems created by limited attention span human inability to deal with more than one difficult problem at a time. He concludes that we must recognize the limitations on our capabilities for rational choice and pursue goals that, in their tentativeness and flexibility, are compatible with those limits.},

  abstract = {The economies of modern industrialized society can more appropriately be labeled organizational economies than market economies. Thus, even market-driven capitalist economies need a theory of organizations as much as they need a theory of markets. The attempts of the new institutional economics to explain organizational behavior solely in terms of agency, asymmetric information, transaction costs, opportunism, and other concepts drawn from neoclassical economics ignore key organizational mechanisms like authority, identification, and coordination, and hence are seriously incomplete. The theory presented here is simple and coherent, resting on only a few mechanisms that are causally linked. Better yet, it agrees with empirical observations of organizational phenomena. Large organizations, especially governmental ones, are often caricatured as "bureaucracies," but they are often highly effective systems, despite the fact that the profit motive can penetrate these vast structures only by indirect means.},

Simon applies his pioneering theory of human choice and administrative decision-making to concrete organizational problems. To commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the book's original publication, Professor Simon enhances his timeless observations on the human decision-making process with commentaries examining new facets of organizational behavior. Investigating the impact of changing social values and modem technology on the operation of organizations, the new ideas featured in this revised edition update a book that has become a worldwide classic.  Named by Public Administration Review as "Book of the Half Century," Administrative Behavior is considered one of the most influential books on social science thinking, and was referred to by the Nobel Committee as "epoch-making."  Written for managers and other professionals who wish to understand the decision-making processes at the heart of organization and management, it is also essential reading for students in business and management, economics, sociology, psychology computer science, government, and law.},

It is further argued that her association with the nignakku-censer only very rarely identifies her as the censer. In the vast majority of cases, the censer should be understood simply as one of several objects which Kusu uses in her role as purifier.},

The present study aimed to investigate the proximate factors influencing the duration of PPA. A community-based, cross-sectional study was conducted in four valley districts of Manipur, India, during 1 August—31 December 2009, to analyze the differentials and determinants of duration of PPA, applying the survival analysis technique. In total, 1,225 ever-married women were selected through two-stage cluster sampling. The median duration of PPA was 5.7 months. Among the 11 explanatory variables of interest, only three variables—place of residence (p{$<$}0.05), infant mortality from preceding pregnancy (p{$<$}0.01), and duration of breastfeeding (p{$<$}0.01)—had a significant effect on the duration of PPA. The findings may be used as baseline information for future researchers and maternal health policy-makers.},

We find that 6th millennium BCE populations of North/Central Anatolia and the Southern Caucasus shared mixed ancestry on a genetic cline that formed during the Neolithic between Western Anatolia and regions in today’s Southern Caucasus/Zagros. During the Late Chalcolithic and/or the Early Bronze Age, more than half of the Northern Levantine gene pool was replaced, while in the rest of Anatolia and the Southern Caucasus, we document genetic continuity with only transient gene flow. Additionally, we reveal a genetically distinct individual within the Late Bronze Age Northern Levant. Overall, our study uncovers multiple scales of population dynamics through time, from extensive admixture during the Neolithic period to long-distance mobility within the globalized societies of the Late Bronze Age.

It points to how social history's emphasis on the depth, breadth, and braided nature of historical experience has helped inform writing on the senses and considers some of the methodological and conceptual questions and concerns arising from histories of the senses. The essay concludes by suggesting the probable importance of social and sensory history for historical writing generally.},

An operational definition of expressions of time in common usage shows that social phenomena are frequently adopted as a frame of reference so that units of time are often fixed by the rhythm of collective life. The need for social collaboration is at the root of social systems of time. Social time is qualitatively differentiated according to the beliefs and customs common to the group. Social time is not continuous but is interrupted by critical dates. All calendrical systems arise from and are perpetuated by social requirements. They arise from social differentiation and a widening area of social interaction. It is possible that the introduction of social time as a methodological category would enhance the discovery of social periodicities.},

Recent events have confirmed that money is only a useful tool in economic exchange if it is trusted, and this is a concept that this text explores in depth. The international panel of experts assembled here offers a long-range perspective, from ancient Assyria to modern societies in Europe, China and the US.

Thus, as an institution and as an idea, the archive offers a historical concept of time that is based on specific evidence and perceived authenticity. This hypothesis forms the main focus of my article. Scholars have recently argued that time cannot be perceived when it is in motion; fixing it would therefore enable the handling of time and the construction of specific—that is, historically contextualized and socioculturally and politically relevant—chronotypes. Hence, the archive's status as a complex of repository buildings, archival documents, institutional structures, and scientific practices means that it can be understood as a paradigmatic institution in which projects involving the formation of a concrete chronotype are carried out. This special quality of the archive enables us to discuss its relevance not only at times of crisis and temporal acceleration but also in the experiences of contingency that can be observed in almost all nineteenth-century European societies. With this historical context in mind, my article raises the question of whether the archive can be read as an authority that helped people to regain orientation in time by constructing and communicating a specific pattern of time. To be more precise, it understands the archive as a physical and conceptual space of time—a chronotopos—in which a historically, nationally bound concept of time is rooted. This interpretation of the archive as a time-ordering institution helps to shed light on the assemblage of temporal orders in modernity. I thus propose that the historical conceptualization of time qua archive—and the archive's materiality and organic nature—helped to foster a nationalized understanding of time that was not abstract and arbitrary but rather evident and authentic.},

The international meetings tackled questions related to merchants and money in a comparative perspective, with examples spanning from the Bronze Age to the early Modern period and embracing Europe, the Mediterranean, Asia and East Africa. The first part of this volume presents historical case studies of how merchants planned and carried out commercial expeditions; how risk, cost, and potential profit was calculated; and how the value of goods was calculated and converted. The papers in the second part address current theories and methods on the development and function of money before and after the invention of coinage. The introduction of balance scales around 3000 BCE enabled the formation of overarching indexes of value and the calculation of the commercial value of goods and services. It also allowed for a selected set of commodities to take on the role of currency. Around 650 BCE, this led to the invention of coinage in the Eastern Mediterranean.},

  abstract = {We argue that the initial three-part mandate for organization theory contained study of (1) internal organization structure and process; (2) relations between organizations and environmental actors; and (3) the impact of organizations on the broad social systems in which they were embedded. Though the influence of organizations in society has increased over time, the social system component of the field's mandate has faded from the research agenda. This paper proposes that the diminution of this social systems perspective occurred because the increasing complexity of social relations made determination of an appropriate unit of analysis more difficult. In addition, the business school environment in which organization research was accomplished discouraged examination of broad social questions, promoted a particular approach to science, and created specific career incentives. Recapturing a research interest in organizations' effects on society requires recognizing organizational impacts on social issues and accepting a broader range of methodologies. Ideas require greater opportunity for development, and quantity of publications deserves less emphasis. Journals that risk publishing the unconventional paper and providing incentives for tackling larger questions might reestablish the breadth of focus with which organizational theory was initially concerned.}

In the last few years, discoveries of new texts and archaeological materials from the Sealand Dynasty have emerged, which expand the possibilities to fill this gap in our knowledge of Mesopotamian history. At the same time, scholars have started to revive Kassite studies using new materials, methods, and questions. While those works are groundbreaking contributions to the field, many questions about the history and chronology, archaeology, economy, language of Babylonia during this period are still unsolved. This volume brings together eleven contributions by leading scholars in the Sealand and Kassite period, approaching those questions from an archaeological, ethnological, historical, linguistic, and economical point of view. The book opens with an introduction into the history and research on Babylonia under the Sealand Dynasty and the Kassites.},

By converting marriage ties into a directed graph we are able to reveal that Babylonian priests observed a complex marriage system known in sociological literature as hypergamy. This system involves the marriage of a lower-status bride to a higher-status groom. In the marriage system of Babylonian priests, status was assigned according to the purity-based hierarchy of the temple – all this is indicative of a highly hierarchized society that was deeply influenced by the temple fabric.},

Combining the use of social network analysis, anthropological studies, and sociological concepts concerned with kinship, tie strength, social boundaries, and identity formation, Bastian Still's interdisciplinary approach transcends the traditional boundary of cuneiform studies and enables the field of Assyriology to contribute to a more general socio-historical discourse},

Prophecy in the Ancient Near East is the first book-length study that compares prophecy in the ancient Near East by focusing on texts from Mari, the Neo-Assyrian State Archives, and the Hebrew Bible. The author analyzes prophecy in each culture independently before comparisons are made. This method demonstrates how prophecy is a part of the wider system of divination, but also shows where scholarship has unduly imported concepts found in one corpus to the other two. This method, for example, calls into question the supposed link between music and prophecy from the Hebrew Bible to the ancient Near East. This work provides an up-to-date analysis of ancient Near Eastern, including Israelite and Judean, prophecy to scholars and students alike. Í thoroughly enjoyed reading the book, and I can highly recommend it to anyone interested in prophecy in Israel and the ancient Near East.Ĺena-Sofia Tiemeyer, University of Aberdeen, Review of Biblical Literature T́he content of Jonathan Stökl’s book...testifies to the value of the book for the studies of prophecy in the ancient Near East.Ẃojciech Pikor, John Paul II Catholic University of Lublin, The Biblical Annals},

  abstract = {"Donors, leaders of nonprofits, and public policy makers usually have the best of intentions to serve society and improve social conditions. But often their solutions fall far short of what they want to accomplish and what is truly needed. Moreover, the answers they propose and fund often produce the opposite of what they want over time. We end up with temporary shelters that increase homelessness, drug busts that increase drug-related crime, or food aid that increases starvation. How do these unintended consequences come about and how can we avoid them? By applying conventional thinking to complex social problems, we often perpetuate the very problems we try so hard to solve, but it is possible to think differently, and get different results. Systems Thinking for Social Change enables readers to contribute more effectively to society by helping them understand what systems thinking is and why it is so important in their work. It also gives concrete guidance on how to incorporate systems thinking in problem solving, decision making, and strategic planning without becoming a technical expert. Systems thinking leader David Stroh walks readers through techniques he has used to help people end homelessness and increase affordable housing, improve public health, strengthen public education and access to early childhood development services, protect child welfare, reform the criminal justice system, resolve identity-based conflicts, and more. The result is a highly readable, effective guide to understanding systems and using that knowledge to get the results you want"--},

  abstract = {The main problem that is addressed in this article is how to use Max Weber?s concept of the ideal type in concrete sociological research. The ideal type was invented by Weber more than a century ago, but has rarely been used in empirical research. One reason for this is that Weber was not very clear on what is meant by an ideal type. Another is that students of Weber?s work have not been very interested in presenting the ideal type in such a way that it can be used. Instead, it has been surrounded by an air of difficulty and unresolved theoretical questions, something that has made the average social scientist confused and unable to use Weber?s concept in his or her own research. In this article, it is argued that despite existing difficulties, we know enough today about the ideal type to use it effectively. A practical guide for how to construct as well as use an ideal type is provided. As a background to this argument, the development of the ideal type in Weber?s work is presented, drawing on a suggestion by Alfred Schutz that Weber originally designed this concept with history in mind, but then switched to sociology.},

Additionally, the authors include new entries designed to help researchers use Weber's ideas in their own work; they illuminate how Weber himself thought theorizing should occur and how he went about constructing a theory. More than an elementary dictionary, however, this work makes a contribution to the general culture and legacy of Weber's work. In addition to entries on broad topics like religion, law, and the West, the completed German definitive edition of Weber's work (Max Weber Gesamtausgabe) necessitated a wealth of new entries and added information on topics like pragmatism and race and racism. Every entry in the dictionary delves into Weber scholarship and acts as a point of departure for discussion and research. As such, this book will be an invaluable resource to general readers, students, and scholars alike.},

The rules of good writing are deceptively simple but this book helps writers to see those principles at work, through examples by stylish authors from Charles Dickens to John McPhee. First published in 2007, The Writer's Diet became a bestselling handbook and now returns refreshed alongside a new version of www.writersdiet.com.

  abstract = {This article reflects on the expectations and changes that digital technologies have brought to history, activities that are increasingly codified as digital history. Because of the breadth of digital technologies and communicative media, the contours of a digital history are still unclear, so I frame my discussion with two potential narratives that begin from different ideas that emerged from World War II weapons research. One narrative begins with Roberto Busa and the application of a computer to find concordances in the writings of Saint Thomas Aquinas. The emphasis here is on the application of computer technologies to the practice of history. The second narrative begins with Vannevar Bush's essay “As We May Think” and focuses on digital technologies as a key element in an information system. This beginning invites a parallel between inscription technologies (especially the movable-type press) and knowledge systems. Both narratives imbibe the modern faith in technology to improve; the “new” is better, but the latter better involves humans and societies. Despite important differences between them, both narratives lead to an inquiry into the foundations of our modern knowledge system. In the case of history, the question is whether a knowledge system that was developed in the nineteenth century and designed to encompass and order the world into one system is still apposite in our digital world. I close by suggesting that one such presumption that needs to be reconsidered is the idea of the past as a prior and distant time-form. A shift from “the past” to “pasts” opens history to a broader field of previous happenings and a reconsideration of chronological time, of change, and to other modes of transmission, such as storytelling.},

This short, approachable book implores the humanities and humanistic social sciences to actively embrace the richness of different times that are evident in non-modern societies and have become common in several scientific fields throughout the twentieth century. Tanaka first offers a history of chronology by showing how the social structures built on clocks and calendars gained material expression. Tanaka then proposes that we can move away from this chronology by considering how contemporary scientific understandings of time might be adapted to reconceive the present and pasts. This opens up a conversation that allows for the possibility of other ways to know about and re-present pasts. A multiplicity of times will help us broaden the historical horizon by embracing the heterogeneity of our lives and world via rethinking the complex interaction between stability, repetition, and change. This history without chronology also allows for incorporating the affordances of digital media.},

Here, the authors examine horse remains of Mongolia's Deer Stone-Khirigsuur (DSK) Complex, comparing them with ancient and modern East Asian horses used for both types of transport. DSK horses demonstrate unique dentition damage that could result from steppe chariotry, but may also indicate riding with a shallow rein angle at a fast gait.

It compares some of the demographic aspects proper to this group with other intensively studied past populations, such as Roman Egypt, Medieval Tuscany, and American slave plantations. It suggests that families, especially those headed by single mothers, acted as a counter measure against population reduction (flight and death) and as a means for the state to control this labor force. The work marks a step forward in the use of quantitative measures in conjunction with cuneiform sources to achieve a better understanding of the social and economic forces that affected ancient Near Eastern populations.},

  abstract = {This article edits two previously unpublished Kassite period texts from Nippur. Their contents raise three points about cultic practice and ideological transmission in Babylonia under Kassite rule. First, they demonstrate that, by the thirteenth century, akītu celebrations connected to Marduk and the city of Babylon were being held at Nippur, and therefore contain the earliest, explicit references to the akītu festival of Marduk from a southern Mesopotamian city that is not Babylon. This discovery forces reappraisals of some aspects of the development of the elevated Marduk ideology and the proposed Babylon +Nippur/Marduk+Enlil pairing. Second, one of the texts, CBS 10616, presents clear evidence of rituals and celebrations that have been hinted at in later scholarly works, such as Astrolabe B, OECT 11: 69+70 and the Nippur Compendium, but whose practice heretofore has never been directly attested. Third, these texts and associated issues ostensibly alter current views on the adoption of Nippur cultic ideology by institutions in Babylon and Ashur throughout the second and early first millennium. They are particularly germane to the mechanisms, timing, and sources by which Babylonian intellectual and religious thought found its way into the written record of Assyria.},

In addition to the familiar positive evidence of structures and deposits, there is now a wealth of ‘true-negative’ evidence: the confirmed absence of archaeological remains. Making good use of such data presents a challenge and demands new ways of thinking. Using case studies based on recent developer-led work in the UK, the authors suggest that focusing on ‘fingerprints’ of past human activity at a landscape scale provides a useful approach. The results argue in favour of changes to existing recording systems, as well as the need to integrate more fully both positive and negative evidence in archaeological interpretation.},

Parsons did not see them this way. His lengthy introduction sought to insert them into his own “action frame of reference”, and his rearrangement of the text made it difficult for a reader to understand why it was constructed the way that it is. This essay describes how Parsons came to be principal translator and editor of the text, examines the changes that he made to it, and links his editorial practice to the analytical procedures that he followed in his Structure of Social Action.},

  abstract = {Weber's writings on action and the explanation of action do not present a particularly coherent view. In his earlier writings, from 1903-1907, he is under the sway of a juristic conception of cause based on the probability doctrines of von Kries, and this is reflected in his writings on action, which de-emphasize problems of interpretation and stress the analytic uses of methods of causal analysis. In the Logos essay, problems of interpretation and problems of cause and probability are discussed on a par. In the "Introduction" to Economy and Society, problems of interpretation, in particular of the application of the ideal-type "rational action," become central. The terminology of the von Kriesian theory disappears, and the requirements for "causal adequacy" are minimized, as is the analytic role of causal reasoning. Weber's various arguments are intelligible solutions to standard problems in the philosophy of action with recent analogues, notably in the work of Donald Davidson. These solutions suggest an alternative account of the significance of "intelligibility" as an aim of sociological approaches to action.},

I take examples of such knowledge from evolutionary biology, behavior genetics, and behavioral endocrinology.}

It is proposed that (a) bureaucratic variables are positively associated; (b) rational variables are positively associated; but that (c) rational variables are negatively associated with bureaucratic variables. This hypothesis is supported by a comparative analysis of 150 formal organizations in 150 nonindustrial societies, using data largely from the Human Relations Area Files. Implications of the findings are explored for, first, the use of the concept "informal organization;" and, second, the development of a general organizational model. Such a model is proposed in outline and illustrated from the descriptive industrial sociological literature.},

In this paper, we combine two well-established frameworks: Linked Data to obtain a rich data structure, and Network Science to explore different research questions regarding the structure and the evolution of ancient societies. We propose a multi-disciplinary pipeline where, starting from a semantically annotated prosopographic archive, a research question is translated into a query on the archive and the obtained dataset is the input to the network model. We applied this pipeline to different archives, a Hittite and a Kassite collection of cuneiform tablets. Finally, network visualization is presented as a powerful tool to highlight both the data structure and the social network analysis results.},

This book argues that the biblical confusion really happened in the ancient Near East, not in speech, however, but in writing. It examines the millennia-long history of writing in the region and shows a radical change from the third and second millennia to the first millennium BC. Before “Babel” any intellectual who wrote did so as a participant in a cosmopolitan tradition with its roots in Babylonia, its language, and its cuneiform script. After “Babel” scribes from all over the eastern Mediterranean, including Greece, used a profusion of vernacular languages and scripts to express themselves. Yet they did so in dialogue with the Babylonian cuneiform tradition still maintained by the successive Assyrian, Babylonian, and Persian empires that controlled their world, oftentimes as acts of resistance, aware of cosmopolitan ideas and motifs but subverting them. In order to frame the rich intellectual history of this region in the ancient past Before and after Babel describes and analyzes the Babylonian cosmopolitan system, how ancient Greek, Hebrew, Aramaic, and other vernacular systems interacted with it in multiple and intricate ways, and their consequences.                                                        ,                “The Lord confused the language of all the earth,” so the Tower of Babel story in the Hebrew Bible's book of Genesis tells us to explain why the world's people communicate in countless languages while previously they all spoke only one.

  abstract = {Babylonia in the second half of the 2nd millennium BCE is one of the most understudied periods of Mesopotamian history. In the last few years, discoveries of new texts and archaeological materials from the Sealand Dynasty have emerged, which expand the possibilities to fill this gap in our knowledge of Mesopotamian history. At the same time, scholars have started to revive Kassite studies using new materials, methods, and questions. While those works are groundbreaking contributions to the field, many questions about the history and chronology, archaeology, economy, language of Babylonia during this period are still unsolved. This volume brings together eleven contributions by leading scholars in the Sealand and Kassite period, approaching those questions from an archaeological, ethnological, historical, linguistic, and economical point of view. The book opens with an introduction into the history and research on Babylonia under the Sealand Dynasty and the Kassites.},

However, archival methods are also employed by scholars engaged in non-historical investigations of documents and texts produced by and about contemporary organizations, often as tools to supplement other research strategies (field methods, survey methods, etc.) Thus, archival methods can also be applied to the analysis of digital texts including electronic databases, emails, and web pages.},

And yet, unlike other relevant languages written over a long period of time, there has been no volume dedicated to its own history. The aim of the present work is to fill that void. The outcome is presented in 26 chapters written by 25 leading authors and divided into two volumes: the first covering the linguistic background and early periods and the second covering the second and first millennia BCE as well as its afterlife"--},

  abstract = {Written records, like other artifacts, were produced and used under particular circumstances that are usually reflected-if only indirectly-in the locations where they are found. However, the archaeological findspots of inscribed artifacts are often neglected in the study of the texts inscribed on them. Such has been the case with the cuneiform tablets found in C. L. Woolley's excavations at Alalaḫ. For over half a century, the Alalaḫ tablets have been utilized in historical and philological research with little consideration of their findspots, though these were duly recorded in the course of excavation. The present article collects the archaeological data pertaining to the tablets found at 15th-century Alalaḫ IV and reintegrates these data with the tablets' contents. On this basis the archives are reconstructed, described, and interpreted in terms of their spatial locations, prosopography, textual content, and chronology. This investigation reveals not only patterns of tablet use and storage, but hitherto unobserved aspects of the society that produced the tablets and the history to which they attest.},

  abstract = {Marduk-remanni was a Babylonian man who lived in the provincial town of Sippar during the first decades of Persian rule in Mesopotamia (second half of the sixth century BC). His archive of c. 187 cuneiform texts was found in 1881 during excavations carried out on behalf of the British Museum, but since then it has received little attention. On first sight, the historical relevance of Marduk-remanni's records seems minimal. They relate to his private assets, business enterprises, and legal concerns - matters that barely seem to transcend the personal and local spheres. But upon closer scrutiny, it becomes clear that Marduk-remanni was at the centre of a far-flung personal network and that his life, despite his having lived far from the political centre, reflects many of the developments and changes taking place at the highest imperial level. He was a child when Cyrus the Great of Persia conquered Babylonia, and although this regime change caused little upheaval outside the political arena at first, by the time of Marduk-remanni's death several decades later, the world of his childhood had changed. His life had taken a completely different course than that of his father and grandfather. He had traveled near and far, visiting the Persian court at Susa on several occasions. No longer were the horizons of his world confined to the Babylonian heartland, as they had been for his father and grandfather. Marduk-remanni was born in provincial Babylonia, but he died as a citizen of a world empire. This book traces the social, economic and political dynamics that transformed his life.},

Non-elite families negotiated different terms of marriage than elite families, in three areas: bridal wealth, household creation, and regulations about adultery and divorce. However, these divergent marriage practices became less pronounced and eventually obsolete in the course of the Persian period. This article first presents the evidence for the two marriage types and then seeks to find an answer, albeit a partial one, to the question why these traditions changed from c. 490 BCE onwards.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}}

Previous scholarship on diplomacy has largely concentrated on the philological analyses of Late Bronze Age diplomatic texts and the artistic styles of luxury visual arts, attempting to identify the origins of specific artistic styles and correlate gift lists with actual material objects. This thesis departs from these prior studies by adopting a more firmly sociological and anthropological approach, focusing on the social and ceremonial contexts of diplomatic activity. In particular, the role of etiquette (ritualized and codified forms of behavior) in diplomacy is the primary focus. Via a holistic analysis incorporating material culture, texts, and art, the thesis discusses how forms of etiquette can be reconstructed from the archaeological record, if forms of etiquette transmission can be identified, and the extent to which these transmissions can be used to reconstruct diplomatic relationships.},

  abstract = {"This volume examines the role of gestures in past societies, exploring both how meaning was communicated through bodily actions, and also how archaeologists can trace the symbolism and significance of ancient gestures, ritual practices and bodily techniques through the material remnants of past human groups. Gesture studies is an area of increasing interest within the social sciences, and the individual chapters not only respond to developments in the field, but push it forward by bringing a wide range of perspectives and approaches into dialogue with one another. Each exhibits a critical and reflexive approach to bodily communication and to re-tracing bodies through the archaeological record (in art, the treatment of the body and material culture), and together they demonstrate the diversity of pioneering global research on gestures in archaeology and related disciplines, with contributions from leading researchers in Aegean, Mediterranean, Mesoamerican, Japanese and Near Eastern archaeology. By bringing case studies from each of these different cultures and regions together and drawing on interdisciplinary insights from anthropology, sociology, psychology, linguistics, design, art history and the performing arts, this volume reveals the similarities and differences in gestures as expressed in cultures around the world, and offers new and valuable perspectives on the nature of bodily communication across both space and time"--},

They were written between 1903 and 1917, the most productive of Max Weber's life, when he was working on his studies in the sociology of religion and Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft. Weber had done important work in economic and legal history and had taught economic theory. On the basis of original investigations, he had acquired a specialist's knowledge of the details of German economic and social structure. His always vital concern for the political prosperity of Germany among the nations thrust him deeply into discussion of political ideals and programs. Weber's methodology still holds interest for us. Some of its shortcomings, from the contemporary viewpoint, may be attributed to the fact that some of the methodological problems that he treated could not be satisfactorily resolved prior to certain actual developments in research technique. These few qualifications aside, the work remains a pioneering work in large scale social research, from one of the field's masters.},

Des animaux étaient également inhumés dans ces chambres funéraires, en particulier des squelettes complets ou partiels de moutons, de chèvres, de bœufs, de chiens adultes ainsi que différents types de volailles. Séparément de ces chambres, inhumés dans leur propre structure de briques en terre, les squelettes complets et partiels de 26 équidés, au moins, ont été retrouvés. De telles installations sont uniques dans la Syrie et la Mésopotamie du IIIe millénaire. Les analyses en cours des caractéristiques morphologiques, métriques et des proportions de ces équidés montrent qu’ils diffèrent des autres équidés trouvés à Umm el Marra et également de ceux trouvés sur d’autres sites du Proche-Orient ancien. Les particularités morphologiques et métriques principales indiquent que ces animaux n’étaient ni des ânes, ni des onagres, ni des chevaux. Bien que la question de leur détermination reste ouverte, ils pourraient de manière plausible être identifiés comme les équidés hybrides d’un statut particulièrement élevé du milieu à la fin du IIIe millénaire, les kunga : croisements entre onagre et âne.},

But he also had a profound scholarly interest in ancient societies and the Near East, and turned the youthful discipline of sociology to the study of these archaic cultures. The Agrarian Sociology of Ancient Civilizations ' Weber's neglected masterpiece, first published in German in 1897 and reissued in 1909 ' is a fascinating examination of the civilizations of Mesopotamia, Egypt, Hebrew society in Israel, the city-states of classical Greece, the Hellenistic world and, finally, Republican and Imperial Rome. The book is infused with the excitement attendant when new intellectual tools are brought to bear on familiar subjects. Throughout the work, Weber blends a description of socio-economic structures with an investigation into mechanisms and causes in the rise and decline of social systems. The volume ends with a magisterial explanatory essay on the underlying reasons for the fall of the Roman Empire. From the Trade Paperback edition.},

It consists of diverse essays that Weber was working on at the time of his death in 1920, ranging over subjects in economics, politics, religion, public administration, and sociology. The book was first published in German in two parts in the early 1920s, then in a more authoritative edition in the late 1950s. Economy and Society is a classic work of social theory, and is considered the founding text for modern social debates about action, rationality, bureaucracy and charisma, formal and material justice, religious beliefs, and economic conduct. In this new translation of Part I, Keith Tribe, one of the English-speaking world's leading experts on Weber, aims to present the clearest and most faithful translation yet. Tribe's translation is accompanied by commentary and notes that reflect the decades of scholarship that have passed since Guenther Roth and Claus Wittich published their English translation in 1968.--},

New evidence is presented for both words in lexical lists, with care taken to make explicit the philogical contexts in which they occur. The question of the etymology of the Semitic word is approached, with an evaluation of the kinds of evidence available. It is suggested that derivation from *ḥyy "life" is indeed plausible, although not from the stem-form *ḥayyum. The divine names Ea and Ḫaya, spouse of Nissaba, are also considered. While Ea and Ḫaya may be at some remove genetically related to each other and to e(y)yû they should not be considered to be identical in historical epochs.},

The purpose of this study is to offer, without prior assumptions, textual evidence that establishes the existence of the concept of patronage. The approach is to present case studies from various parts of the region which are best explained by the presence of patronage. For these purposes patronage is narrowly defined on the basis of ancient Roman and contemporary anthropological models. /// Les historiens du Proche-Orient ancien supposent que le patronage était un phénomène universel dans la région, sans que ce sujet n'ait fait l'objet d'une étude approfondie. Dans cet article je propose de présenter sans présomptions préalables des preuves textuelles que le concept de patronage existait. L'approche est de présenter des cas concrets provenants de plusieurs parties de la région qui s'expliquent au mieux par la présence du patronage. À ces fins, j'adopte une définition étroite du patronage, à la base de modèles romains anciens et antropologiques modernes.}

  abstract = {This dissertation takes a new look at the international relations attested in the cuneiform archives recovered from Early Bronze Age Ebla (\textasciitilde ca. 2350 BCE, Middle Chronology). It is argued that a primary goal of Ebla's diplomatic relationships with the other major powers on the international scene was to ensure that trade paths remained open. It cooperated with other distant states – above all Mari on the Middle Euphrates – in order to profit from and dominate trade at the expense of lesser powers that were caught up in between them, such as Abarsal on the Upper Euphrates, and Manuwat, near the Euphrates between Ebla and Mari. Chapter 1 outlines the goal, method, and historical context. Chapter 2 offers a geographic overview of Ebla and its relations with its major neighbors. Chapter 3 establishes the context of Ebla's earliest relations with Mari, and how this led to Ebla's supremacy over its rival Abarsal. Chapter 4 situates Armi, one of Ebla's most important allies, in Cilicia, and shows how Ebla sought to capitalize on its geographic position, which allowed access to routes leading into Anatolia. Chapter 5 investigates Ebla's diplomatic and mercantile relations with Hassuwan, another power with an Anatolia connection and with which Ebla had important mercantile links. Chapter 6 explores the kingdom of Kakmium, for which a location in the Amuq valley, in between Armi and Ebla, is argued. Chapter 7 returns to Mari, and situates Ebla's later relations with that power in the light of the results of the preceding chapters. Chapter 8 offers conclusions and avenues for further research, while also pursuing initial investigations into the causes of the collapse of Ebla and its international system. Throughout the work, partial text editions and translations of original sources are offered, along with investigations into selected key terms.},

  abstract = {In seeking to recover the semantic relationships that led the Euphrates and Sippar to share the writing UD.KIB.NUN, this paper begins with an analysis of the earliest writings for river and city. It is found that the essential elements of this Diri compound, KIB.NUN, first designated the divine Euphrates; only as a secondary development did the city borrow the spelling from the river. Further, it is suggested that the writing UD.KIB.NUN belongs to the UD.GAL.NUN orthographic tradition. As for the city taking its spelling from the river, the explanation lies, on one hand, in the functional overlap of the Sun- and River-gods and, on the other, in the unique topography of the Sippar region. The aspect of divine judge defines both the Sun-god, the patron deity of Sippar, and the River-god, the divine Euphrates being a particular manifestation of dí d /d Nāru – indeed, the textual and artistic records together describe a mythological and cosmographical conception that links these two deities. The Sippar region, it is argued, was an early cult center of the River-god and was regarded as a numen loci on account of the unique geomorphological conditions specific to the area.}

  abstract = {Otis Dudley Duncan, who died in November 2004, had enormous impact on the practice of quantitative reasoning in sociology and demography today. This paper traces the influence of Duncan as a quantitative sociologist within the context of the history of science. I locate Duncan's philosophy of social science within the tradition of “population thinking” that was begun by Charles Darwin and introduced to social science by Francis Galton. As part of this exploration, I distinguish two approaches to statistical analysis (emanating from the two main philosophical views of science): Gaussian or typological thinking, and Galtonian or population thinking. I examine in detail Duncan's views of quantitative reasoning in the social sciences, particularly his opinions on social measurement, path analysis, structural modeling, econometrics, and the Rasch model. An important theme of the paper is that Duncan quickly realized the difficulties and limitations of quantitative methodology in social science. In particular, he was bothered by inherent population heterogeneity that makes it futile to draw “law-like” inferences from statistical analyses in social science. Thus, Duncan was disdainful of the search for supposedly universal laws of society that would mimic those of the physical sciences, because he believed that such laws did not exist and would be meaningless. Instead, to Duncan, the main use of statistical tools was to summarize systematic patterns of population variability. The paper draws heavily on Duncan's previously unpublished personal communications.}

This article concentrates on the question of whether and how gender, as an important component of personal identity, found expression in the material, visual, and textual aspects of Babylonian cylinder seals of the Kassite period, a relatively understudied era of Mesopotamian history. Like any other society, ancient Mesopotamia had various complex gender categories, which included, in addition to normative male and female groups, other genders, such as eunuchs and homosexuals. It is argued here that the gender of a seal owner and the nature of the relations between different genders in Kassite-era Babylonian society were communicated through the seal image and labels, as well as through the use of cylinder stones.},

Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

An analysis of this kind has not yet been undertaken, in spite of the wealth of textual material—in fact the trend of Nuzian studies has been mostly towards an elucidation of “juridical” problems, with the result that the field of exchange and trade has been disregarded. Significantly enough, all that we can recall are the two pages on the merchant, written by A. L. Oppenheim in 1939 and the essay of D. Cross, whose main concern was to establish a list of commodities and calculate their prices.With the present investigation I intend to focus on the position of the merchant in the context of Nuzian society and economy, and to analyse the procedures in use for carrying out trade enterprises. Other aspects connected with the subject of trade, e.g. commodities, prices, provenience and destination of goods, etc., will be dealt with in forthcoming articles.},

  abstract = {When Esarhaddon named his successors, he split the empire between two of his sons, with Assurbanipal as king of Assyria and Šamaš-šuma-ukīn as king of Babylonia. This arrangement functioned until 652 BCE, at which point a civil war began between the brothers. The war ended with Assurbanipal’s victory and Šamaš-šuma-ukīn’s death in 648 BCE. While Šamaš-šuma-ukīn’s death is mentioned in several of Assurbanipal’s inscriptions, it is still unclear how the king of Babylon met his end, and scholars have suggested theories ranging from suicide, assassination, execution, and accidental death. By offering a reexamination of the evidence for royal death in general and Šamaš-šuma-ukīn’s demise in particular, this article explores how possibly taboo topics such as fratricide, regicide, and suicide were depicted in Neo-Assyrian state texts and how Assurbanipal appears to have coped with his brother’s rebellion and death, especially as compared to Assyrian treatments of belligerent and rebellious foreign kings. This article argues that the relative silence around Šamaššuma- ukīn’s death is due to the fact that, while he was an enemy combatant, he was nonetheless a member of the Assyrian royal family and a legitimately-installed king. Overall, this article concludes that Assurbanipal uses several rhetorical strategies to distance himself from Šamaš-šuma-ukīn, especially invoking deus ex machina as a way to avoid even the potential accusation of fratricide and ultimately erasing his brother from the written record and Assyrian history.},

Efforts to formulate general theories of society devoid of historical limitation have created serious problems for theoretical work. This article examines two important examples of this tendency: Parson's and Schutz's use of Weberian sociology to derive general theories of social action. A historically grounded procedure for generating concepts was central to Weber's work. It united explanatory and interpretative analysis within a reflexive framework that responded to the intellectual and political interests of the theorist. Early writings of Parsons and Schutz surmount, in different ways, Weber's strictures on the limits of general theory by eliminating the historical component of Weber's thought. This development reversed Weber's theoretical achievement, decomposing his synthesis into hostile theories based on key fragments of his analysis.},

Since the one-mode projection is always less informative than the bipartite representation, a proper weighting method is required to better retain the original information. In this article, inspired by the network-based resource-allocation dynamics, we raise a weighting method, which can be directly applied in extracting the hidden information of networks, with remarkably better performance than the widely used global ranking method as well as collaborative filtering. This work not only provides a creditable method in compressing bipartite networks, but also highlights a possible way for the better solution of a long-standing challenge in modern information science: How to do personal recommendation?},
